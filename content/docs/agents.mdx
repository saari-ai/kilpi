## Skills

Kilpi comes with two skills for appyling the Kilpi methodology, each referencing sections of these docs as its source of truth.

You don't have to use our skills, you can build your own or simply just point your agent towards the docs as reference, however our skills have been tuned to get the best outcomes when applying the methodology.

| Skill | When activated | Reads from |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>kilpi_org</span> | Applying Kilpi at the organisational level | All 6 functions, Template (Org), [Taskflow](/docs/examples/taskflow) example |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>kilpi_component</span> | Applying Kilpi to a specific product or component | Identify, Protect, Detect, Template (Component), [Taskflow](/docs/examples/taskflow) example |

The primary skills that leverage the methodology are available at [saari-ai/kilpi-skills](https://github.com/saari-ai/kilpi-skills).

Claude users can activate the skills via the [Saari Claude Marketplace](https://github.com/saari-ai/claude-marketplace).

Other vendor support coming shortly.
