description: History of changes to the Kilpi methodology
---

## 2026-02-26

- **Scope change:** Org scope now owns only GV, RS, RC. Component scope owns ID, PR, DE. Removed overlap where both levels claimed Identify, Protect, and Detect. The org sets policy; components implement controls.
- Deleted org-level ID, PR, DE template pages (13 files). Template (Org) now covers Govern, Respond, and Recover only.
- Shared infrastructure (shared auth, monitoring platform, CI/CD) is now assessed as its own component, not at the org level.
