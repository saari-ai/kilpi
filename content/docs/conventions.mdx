## ID schemes

We use three prefixed ID schemes to uniquely identify security artifacts across the documentation.

### Control IDs (SC-)

Controls are safeguards implemented to achieve security outcomes. Every control gets a unique ID.

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `SC-{category}-{number}` | SC-AA-1 | First control in the Access Authorization category |
| `SC-{category}-{number}.{sub}` | SC-AA-1.1 | Sub-control under SC-AA-1 |

The `{category}` segment uses the two-letter NIST category code (AA, DS, PS, CM, etc.), keeping controls traceable to the subcategories they satisfy.

### Threat IDs (ST-)

Threats are identified risks that controls mitigate.

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `ST-{product}-{number}` | ST-TF-1 | First threat identified for [Taskflow](/docs/examples/taskflow) |
| `ST-{product}-{number}.{sub}` | ST-TF-1.1 | Sub-threat under ST-TF-1 |

The `{product}` segment is a short code for the product or system (e.g., TF for [Taskflow](/docs/examples/taskflow), SR for Streams).

### Asset IDs (SA-)

Assets are things of value that need protection — data, services, infrastructure.

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `SA-{product}-{number}` | SA-TF-1 | First asset identified for [Taskflow](/docs/examples/taskflow) |

## Subcategory traceability

Every control, threat, and asset should trace back to at least one NIST CSF subcategory. This is how we ensure coverage and avoid gaps.

### In threat model tables

Threat model tables include a **Subcategory** column mapping each threat to the NIST subcategory it relates to:

| ID | Threat | STRIDE | Subcategory |
|----|--------|--------|-------------|
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>ST-TF-1</span> | Unauthorized API access | Spoofing | ID.RA-01 |

### In control inventory tables

Control inventory tables include a **Subcategory** column mapping each control to the subcategory it satisfies:

| ID | Control | Threat | Subcategory |
|----|---------|--------|-------------|
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SC-AA-1</span> | JWT authentication | ST-TF-1 | PR.AA-01 |

### Coverage check

To verify completeness, list the subcategories relevant to your product (from the Identify phase) and confirm each has at least one control mapped to it. Gaps indicate either:

1. A missing control (add one in Protect)
2. A subcategory that genuinely doesn't apply (document the exclusion in your product template)

## Severity levels

We use a four-level severity scale consistently across all functions:

| Level | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 4 | Critical | Existential risk to the product or organization |
| 3 | High | Significant impact requiring prompt action |
| 2 | Medium | Moderate impact, addressed in normal planning cycles |
| 1 | Low | Minimal impact, monitored but not urgently acted on |

Severity drives priority in both risk assessment (Identify) and incident response (Respond).
