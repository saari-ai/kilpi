description: ID schemes, naming conventions, and traceability rules used across the security documentation
---

## ID schemes

We use prefixed ID schemes to uniquely identify security artifacts across the documentation. The `{component}` segment in each scheme is a short code for whatever entity is being assessed (e.g., TF for [Taskflow](/docs/cybersecurity/examples/taskflow), SR for Streams). Component codes are formally defined in the [Component Register](/docs/cybersecurity/templates/component-register).

### Control IDs (SC-)

Controls are safeguards implemented to achieve security outcomes. Every control gets a unique ID.

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `SC-{component}-{number}` | SC-TF-1 | First control for [Taskflow](/docs/cybersecurity/examples/taskflow) |
| `SC-{component}-{number}.{sub}` | SC-TF-1.1 | Sub-control under SC-TF-1 |

### Threat IDs (ST-)

Threats are identified risks that controls mitigate.

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `ST-{component}-{number}` | ST-TF-1 | First threat identified for [Taskflow](/docs/cybersecurity/examples/taskflow) |
| `ST-{component}-{number}.{sub}` | ST-TF-1.1 | Sub-threat under ST-TF-1 |

### Asset IDs (SA-)

Assets are things of value that need protection — data, services, infrastructure.

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `SA-{component}-{number}` | SA-TF-1 | First asset identified for [Taskflow](/docs/cybersecurity/examples/taskflow) |

### Monitoring Rule IDs (SM-)

Monitoring rules define how you detect when a control fails or is bypassed (used in [Detect](/docs/cybersecurity/functions/detect)).

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `SM-{component}-{number}` | SM-TF-1 | First monitoring rule for [Taskflow](/docs/cybersecurity/examples/taskflow) |

### Response Playbook IDs (SP-)

Response playbooks define the actions taken when a monitoring rule fires (used in [Respond](/docs/cybersecurity/functions/respond)).

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `SP-{component}-{number}` | SP-TF-1 | First response playbook for [Taskflow](/docs/cybersecurity/examples/taskflow) |

### Recovery Plan IDs (SR-)

Recovery plans define how to restore services after an incident (used in [Recover](/docs/cybersecurity/functions/recover)).

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `SR-{component}-{number}` | SR-TF-1 | First recovery plan for [Taskflow](/docs/cybersecurity/examples/taskflow) |

## NIST category codes

Each NIST CSF 2.0 category has a two-letter code. These codes appear in subcategory IDs throughout the methodology (e.g., PR.AA-01 is subcategory 01 of the Access Control category under Protect).

| Code | Category | Function |
|------|----------|----------|
| OC | Organizational Context | Govern |
| RM | Risk Management Strategy | Govern |
| RR | Roles, Responsibilities, and Authorities | Govern |
| PO | Policy | Govern |
| OV | Oversight | Govern |
| SC | Supply Chain Risk Management | Govern |
| AM | Asset Management | Identify |
| RA | Risk Assessment | Identify |
| IM | Improvement | Identify |
| AA | Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control | Protect |
| AT | Awareness and Training | Protect |
| DS | Data Security | Protect |
| PS | Platform Security | Protect |
| IR | Technology Infrastructure Resilience | Protect |
| CM | Continuous Monitoring | Detect |
| AE | Adverse Event Analysis | Detect |
| MA | Incident Management | Respond |
| AN | Incident Analysis | Respond |
| CO | Incident Response Reporting / Recovery Communication | Respond, Recover |
| MI | Incident Mitigation | Respond |
| RP | Recovery Plan Execution | Recover |

## Subcategory traceability

Every control, threat, and asset should trace back to at least one NIST CSF subcategory. This is how we ensure coverage and avoid gaps.

### In threat model tables

Threat model tables include a **Subcategory** column mapping each threat to the NIST subcategory it relates to:

| ID | Threat | STRIDE | Subcategory |
|----|--------|--------|-------------|
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>ST-TF-1</span> | Unauthorized API access | Spoofing | ID.RA-01 |

### In control inventory tables

Control inventory tables include a **Subcategory** column mapping each control to the subcategory it satisfies:

| ID | Control | Threat | Subcategory |
|----|---------|--------|-------------|
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SC-TF-1</span> | JWT authentication | ST-TF-1 | PR.AA-01 |

### Coverage check

To verify completeness, list the subcategories relevant to your component (from the Identify phase) and confirm each has at least one control mapped to it. Gaps indicate either:

1. A missing control (add one in [Protect](/docs/cybersecurity/functions/protect))
2. A subcategory that genuinely doesn't apply (document the exclusion in your component template)

## Severity levels

We use a four-level severity scale consistently across all functions:

| Level | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 4 | Critical | Existential risk to the component or organization |
| 3 | High | Significant impact requiring prompt action |
| 2 | Medium | Moderate impact, addressed in normal planning cycles |
| 1 | Low | Minimal impact, monitored but not urgently acted on |

Severity drives priority in both risk assessment (Identify) and incident response (Respond).
