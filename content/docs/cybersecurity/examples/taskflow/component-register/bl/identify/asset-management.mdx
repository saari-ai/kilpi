### ID.AM-01: Hardware inventory

The Billing Portal runs on AWS managed services as a standalone application, separate from the Taskflow core product. There is no physical hardware managed by the organization. The relevant infrastructure assets are:

| Asset | Type | Location | Owner | Criticality |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <span id="SA-BL-1" style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SA-BL-1</span> Billing SPA | React dashboard (standalone from Taskflow) | AWS CloudFront / S3 static hosting | Frontend team | High |
| <span id="SA-BL-2" style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SA-BL-2</span> Billing API | Express service with own endpoints | AWS EC2 / ECS | Backend team | Critical |
| <span id="SA-BL-3" style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SA-BL-3</span> Billing database | PostgreSQL (separate from Taskflow DB) | AWS RDS | Backend team | Critical |

### ID.AM-02: Software and services inventory

| Asset | Type | Owner | Data classification | Criticality |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <span id="SA-BL-4" style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SA-BL-4</span> Stripe integration | Payment processing (shared Stripe account, separate API keys) | Backend team | Restricted | Critical |

### ID.AM-03: Network data flows

```
┌──────────────┐        ┌──────────────┐        ┌──────────────┐

                        ┌──────────────┐

─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ TRUST BOUNDARY ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─
  Browser (untrusted)  │  API + internal services (trusted)
```

All communication between the browser and API uses HTTPS (TLS 1.2+). Internal services (API to PostgreSQL) communicate within the VPC. External API calls (Stripe) use HTTPS with server-side API keys.

### ID.AM-04: Supplier services

| Supplier | Service | Data processed | Authorized by | Trust level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Stripe | Payment processing | Payment method tokens, subscription data, invoice records | CTO | High (PCI DSS compliant) |
| AWS | All infrastructure | All billing application data | CTO | High (SOC 2, ISO 27001) |

### ID.AM-05: Asset prioritization

| Classification | Definition |
|---|---|
| Public | Information intended for public access (pricing page, docs) |
| Internal | Operational data not meant for external access (deploy configs, internal metrics) |
| Confidential | User data that requires protection (billing contact details, invoice metadata) |
| Restricted | Data where exposure causes immediate harm (API keys, payment tokens, admin credentials, card data) |

| Criticality | Definition |
|---|---|
| Critical | Service cannot operate without it. Compromise leads to financial fraud or full data breach. |
| High | Service degrades significantly without it. Compromise leads to partial data exposure or feature outage. |
| Medium | Service operates with reduced capability. Compromise has contained impact. |

### ID.AM-07: Data inventory

| Data type | Classification | Owner | Storage location | Retention |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <span id="SA-BL-5" style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SA-BL-5</span> Customer payment data | Restricted | Backend team | Stripe (tokenized) + PostgreSQL (references only) | Per Stripe retention policy |
| <span id="SA-BL-6" style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SA-BL-6</span> Invoice records | Confidential | Backend team | PostgreSQL (billing DB) | 7 years (financial compliance) |
| <span id="SA-BL-7" style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SA-BL-7</span> Stripe API keys | Restricted | Backend team | Secrets manager / env vars | Rotated quarterly |
| <span id="SA-BL-8" style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SA-BL-8</span> Admin credentials | Restricted | Backend team | PostgreSQL (bcrypt hashed) | Until account deletion |
