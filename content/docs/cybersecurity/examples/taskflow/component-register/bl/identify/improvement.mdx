### ID.IM-01: Improvements from evaluations

| Evaluation type | Scope | Frequency | Findings feed into |
|---|---|---|---|
| Quarterly billing threat register review | All 12 threats, all 17 controls | Quarterly | Threat severity re-scoring, control inventory updates |
| Annual security posture review | End-to-end: Govern through Recover | Annually | Policy updates, risk tolerance adjustments, staffing changes |
| PCI readiness self-assessment | Payment data handling, Stripe integration security, access controls, audit logging | Annually (prior to assessment) | Control gaps, evidence collection improvements |
| Dependency audit | All direct and transitive npm dependencies | Monthly | Dependency management policy updates, scanning frequency changes |

### ID.IM-02: Improvements from tests and exercises

| Test type | Target | Last conducted | Findings | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tabletop exercise: payment fraud | Payment validation controls, incident response playbook | Q3 2025 | Amount validation needed server-side re-check against Stripe session | Remediated |
| Tabletop exercise: Stripe key compromise | Secret management, incident response playbook | Q4 2025 | Key rotation runbook needed clearer steps for revoking old key in Stripe dashboard | Updated |
| Penetration test (external) | Full billing portal surface | Q2 2025 | 1 high finding (IDOR on invoice endpoint), 1 medium finding (verbose error on 404) | Remediated |
| Dependency compromise simulation | Dependency management, recovery procedures | Q4 2025 | Stripe SDK pinning needed explicit version lock in package.json | Updated |

### ID.IM-03: Improvements from operations

| Source function | What it produces | How it feeds back |
|---|---|---|
| Detect (monitoring alerts) | False positive / true positive data | Tuning alert thresholds for payment anomalies, refining correlation rules |
| Respond (incident post-mortems) | Root cause analysis, timeline gaps | New threats added to register, controls strengthened, playbooks updated |
| Recover (after-action reports) | Lessons learned, feedback loop updates | Re-scored threat likelihoods, new CI checks, tighter SLAs |
| Day-to-day operations (PR reviews) | Patterns in billing-related code changes | Updated coding standards, new linting rules for payment handling |

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Incident response plan (billing playbooks) | Security lead | Q4 2025 | Q1 2026 | Current |
| Recovery procedures (billing scenarios) | Security lead | Q4 2025 | Q1 2026 | Current |
| PCI readiness checklist | Backend team | Q4 2025 | Q2 2026 | Current |
| Dependency management policy | Dependency maintainer | Q4 2025 | Q2 2026 | Current |
| Data classification policy | Security lead | Q3 2025 | Q1 2026 | Due for review |
