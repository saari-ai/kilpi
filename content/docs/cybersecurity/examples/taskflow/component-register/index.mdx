title: Component Register
description: Taskflow worked example — register of components assessed under the Cybersecurity methodology
---

The Component Register is the bridge between organisational governance and per-component assessments. Every component that will receive an Identify, Protect, and Detect assessment must be listed here first. See [Scope](/docs/cybersecurity/scope#what-constitutes-a-component) for guidance on what constitutes a component.

### Definition of Done

- [x] All components identified and listed in the register below
- [x] Each component has a unique 2–4 letter code
- [x] Owner assigned to every component
- [x] Data classification and criticality rated for every component
- [x] At least one component has a completed assessment

### Register

| Code | Name | Description | Owner | Data classification | Criticality | Assessment status |
|------|------|-------------|-------|---------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| TF | Taskflow | Core product — React SPA, Express API, PostgreSQL, Redis, S3, Stripe and SendGrid integrations | Backend team | Restricted | Critical | Complete |
| BL | Billing Portal | Standalone billing dashboard with its own database and Stripe integration | Backend team | Restricted | High | Complete |
| MK | Marketing Site | Static site with headless CMS, no authentication, public content only | Frontend team | Public | Low | Complete |
| CI | Build Pipeline | Shared CI/CD infrastructure (GitHub Actions) with production secrets | Infrastructure owner | Restricted | Critical | Complete |

The four components exercise the scoping rules from [Scope](/docs/cybersecurity/scope#what-constitutes-a-component): **TF** is the core product treated as a single deployable, **BL** has separate data boundaries, **CI** is shared infrastructure, and **MK** provides a low-criticality contrast. Each component has a complete Identify, Protect, and Detect assessment — navigate to each component section to see the full artefacts.
