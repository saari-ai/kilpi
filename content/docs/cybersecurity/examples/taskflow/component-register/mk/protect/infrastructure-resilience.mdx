### PR.IR-01: Network protection

The marketing site is a static deployment with no server-side runtime. Network protection is simpler than application-hosting components.

| Control | Level | Rule | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| CloudFront HTTPS-only | Application | HTTP requests redirected to HTTPS. TLS 1.2 minimum. | Ensures all visitor communication is encrypted |
| S3 BlockPublicAccess + OAI | Infrastructure | S3 bucket blocks all public access. CloudFront uses Origin Access Identity for S3 reads. | Prevents direct S3 access, forces traffic through CDN |
| Route 53 IAM restrictions | Infrastructure | Only CI deploy role and frontend lead can modify DNS records | Prevents unauthorized DNS changes (<span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SC-MK-4.1</span>) |

**Controls:** <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SC-MK-2.1</span> (CloudFront HTTPS-only), <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SC-MK-2.2</span> (S3 BlockPublicAccess + OAI), <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SC-MK-4.1</span> (Route 53 IAM restrictions)

### PR.IR-02: Environmental protection

The marketing site runs entirely on AWS managed infrastructure. Environmental protections (power, cooling, fire suppression) are managed by AWS. Not applicable to this component.

### PR.IR-03: Resilience mechanisms

| Mechanism | Where applied | Configuration | Failure behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|
| CloudFront edge caching | CDN | Content cached at edge locations worldwide. TTL configured per content type. | Cached content continues to be served even if S3 origin is temporarily unavailable. |
| S3 durability | Static site files | S3 Standard (11 nines durability) + versioning | Files recoverable from versioning. |
| Health checks | CloudFront origin | Origin health check monitors S3 availability | CloudFront serves stale cache if origin is unhealthy. |

The site has no database, no sessions, and no real-time processing. Recovery from any failure is a matter of re-deploying static files from CI.

### PR.IR-04: Capacity management

| Resource | Monitoring | Alert threshold | Scaling approach | Max limit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CloudFront bandwidth | CloudWatch metrics | Cost alert at $100/month | CloudFront scales automatically | N/A (AWS managed) |
| S3 storage | CloudWatch metrics | No hard limit (cost monitoring) | S3 scales automatically | N/A |

Capacity management is minimal. AWS managed services handle scaling automatically. The static nature of the site means traffic spikes are absorbed by CloudFront edge caching without any infrastructure changes.
