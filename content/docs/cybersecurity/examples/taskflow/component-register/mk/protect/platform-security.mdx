### PR.PS-01: Configuration management

| Component | Baseline source | Key settings | Deviation notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Next.js SSG | Next.js security defaults | Static export only (no server runtime), security headers via next.config.js | None |
| S3 bucket | AWS S3 security best practices | BlockPublicAccess enabled, versioning enabled, server-side encryption, no public ACL | None |
| CloudFront | AWS CloudFront best practices | HTTPS-only, TLS 1.2 minimum, Origin Access Identity, custom security headers | None |

### PR.PS-02: Software maintenance

| Component type | Patching approach | SLA (critical / high / medium) | EOL tracking |
|---|---|---|---|
| npm dependencies (direct) | Dependabot PRs, manual triage | Critical: 1 week / High: 2 weeks / Medium: 1 month | Package EOL announcements monitored |
| npm dependencies (transitive) | Dependabot PRs, `npm audit` | Critical: 1 week / High: 2 weeks / Medium: 1 month | Checked monthly |
| Node.js runtime | LTS version, upgrade within 60 days of release | Critical: 14 days / High: 30 days / Medium: 60 days | Node.js LTS schedule tracked |

Patching SLAs are longer than higher-criticality components because the site serves only public content and has no user-facing runtime.

### PR.PS-03: Hardware maintenance

The marketing site runs entirely on AWS managed infrastructure. Hardware maintenance is delegated to AWS under the shared responsibility model.

### PR.PS-04: Logging

| Log source | Format | Destination | Retention | Sensitive data |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CloudFront access logs | AWS standard format | S3 bucket (log archive) | 90 days | Low -- public page requests only |
| CI build logs | CI provider format | CI provider | 30 days | Medium -- may contain build errors referencing env var names (not values) |
| Contentful audit log | Contentful native | Contentful dashboard | Per Contentful retention policy | Low -- content changes only |

---

### PR.PS-05: Software integrity

| Control | Scope | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Lock files | All npm dependencies | `package-lock.json` committed, `npm ci` used in CI (no implicit upgrades) |
| Pre-commit secret scanning | All code commits | Gitleaks runs pre-commit and in CI. Blocks commits containing secret patterns. |
| CI-only deployments | All production deployments | Only CI-built artifacts are deployed to S3. No manual uploads. |

**Controls:** <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SC-MK-3.2</span> (lock file enforcement)

### PR.PS-06: Secure development practices

| Practice | When it runs | Tool / method | Failure action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dependency scanning | Every PR + daily | Dependabot + `npm audit` | PR blocked on critical/high CVEs |
| Secret scanning | Every commit + every CI build | Gitleaks (pre-commit hook + CI step) | Commit blocked / CI build fails |
| Code review | Every PR | Peer review | PR cannot be merged without approval |
