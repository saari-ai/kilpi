### ID.IM-01: Improvements from evaluations

| Evaluation type | Scope | Frequency | Findings feed into |
|---|---|---|---|
| Quarterly threat register review | All 20 threats, all 18 controls | Quarterly | Threat severity re-scoring, control inventory updates |
| Annual security posture review | End-to-end: Govern through Recover | Annually | Policy updates, risk tolerance adjustments, staffing changes |
| SOC 2 readiness self-assessment | Access controls, audit logging, incident response, change management | Annually (prior to audit) | Control gaps, evidence collection improvements |
| Dependency audit | All direct and transitive npm dependencies | Monthly | Dependency management policy updates, scanning frequency changes |

### ID.IM-02: Improvements from tests and exercises

| Test type | Target | Last conducted | Findings | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tabletop exercise: credential stuffing | Authentication controls, incident response playbook 1 | Q3 2025 | Rate limiter threshold too generous (was 20/min, lowered to 5/min) | Remediated |
| Tabletop exercise: S3 bucket exposure | Data access controls, incident response playbook 4 | Q4 2025 | Need automated CloudTrail alert for S3 policy changes | Implemented |
| Penetration test (external) | Full application surface | Q2 2025 | 2 medium findings (CSRF on one endpoint, verbose error on 404) | Remediated |
| Dependency compromise simulation | Dependency management, recovery playbook 5 | Q4 2025 | Server rebuild runbook needed more detail on secret rotation order | Updated |

### ID.IM-03: Improvements from operations

| Source function | What it produces | How it feeds back |
|---|---|---|
| Detect (monitoring alerts) | False positive / true positive data | Tuning alert thresholds, refining correlation rules |
| Respond (incident post-mortems) | Root cause analysis, timeline gaps | New threats added to register, controls strengthened, playbooks updated |
| Recover (after-action reports) | Lessons learned, feedback loop updates | Re-scored threat likelihoods, new CI checks, tighter SLAs |
| Day-to-day operations (PR reviews) | Patterns in security-relevant code changes | Updated coding standards, new linting rules |

### ID.IM-04: Plan maintenance

| Plan | Owner | Last reviewed | Next review | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Incident response plan (6 playbooks) | Security lead | Q4 2025 | Q1 2026 | Current |
| Recovery procedures (5 scenarios) | Security lead | Q4 2025 | Q1 2026 | Current |
| Business continuity plan | CTO | Q3 2025 | Q1 2026 | Due for review |
| Dependency management policy | Dependency maintainer | Q4 2025 | Q2 2026 | Current |
| Data classification policy | Security lead | Q3 2025 | Q1 2026 | Due for review |
