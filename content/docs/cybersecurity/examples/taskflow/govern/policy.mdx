### GV.PO-01: Establish and enforce policy

| Section | Content | Draws from |
|---|---|---|
| Secure coding policy | All application code. Covers parameterised queries, output encoding, schema validation, secret handling. Enforced via PR review checklist and CI linting rules that block violations. | Threat register (<span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>ST-TF-1</span>, <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>ST-TF-2</span>, <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>ST-TF-4</span>, <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>ST-TF-5</span>), control inventory (<span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SC-TF-1.1</span> to <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SC-TF-1.4</span>) |
| Secret management policy | All API keys, credentials, tokens. Secrets must be in environment variables or a secrets manager. Never in source code, logs, or client bundles. Enforced via pre-commit secret scanning (Gitleaks), log masking middleware, CI secret scan step. | Threat register (<span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>ST-TF-11</span>, <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>ST-TF-13</span>), control inventory (<span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SC-TF-5.1</span>, <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SC-TF-5.2</span>) |
| Dependency management policy | All direct and transitive npm dependencies. Critical/high CVEs must be patched within 48 hours. Medium within 2 weeks. Enforced via Dependabot alerts and CI blocking merge on critical/high CVEs. | Threat register (<span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>ST-TF-20</span>), control inventory (<span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SC-TF-8.1</span>) |
| Incident response policy | All security incidents. Defines severity levels, escalation paths, communication timelines. Enforced via escalation matrix in [Respond](/docs/cybersecurity/examples/taskflow/respond). Post-mortem required for Critical incidents. | Response playbooks, escalation matrix |
| Data classification policy | All data handled by Taskflow. Four levels: Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted. Classification drives access controls and encryption requirements. Documented in asset register, enforced by data access controls. | Asset register (<span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>ID.AM-07</span>), control inventory (<span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SC-TF-4.1</span> to <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SC-TF-4.3</span>) |

### GV.PO-02: Policy review and update

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| New feature or integration added | Review whether existing policies cover the new surface area. Add policy sections if needed. |
| Post-incident lessons learned | Update relevant policy sections based on what the incident revealed. |
| Quarterly review cycle | Review all policies for accuracy. Confirm enforcement mechanisms are still active. |
| Regulatory change (GDPR update, new PCI version) | Review affected policies. Update requirements and enforcement timelines. |
| Team structure change | Review roles and policy ownership. Ensure every policy section has a current owner. |

Policies are communicated to all relevant parties during onboarding and when updates are made. The security lead confirms that every team member has read and acknowledged the current policies annually.
