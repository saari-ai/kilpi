### RS.CO-03: Information sharing

| Audience | What to share | Channel | Approval required |
|---|---|---|---|
| Internal engineering team | Full technical details: root cause, attack vector, affected systems, fix | Private Slack channel + incident document | Incident lead |
| CTO / leadership | Impact summary, user count, financial impact, timeline, remediation plan | Email + verbal briefing | Incident lead |
| Legal counsel | Full technical details + affected data types + jurisdictions | Encrypted email or secure document share | Security lead |
| Affected customers | What happened, what was affected, what we did, what they should do | Email (via SendGrid or backup channel if SendGrid is compromised) | Legal counsel + CTO |
| Regulatory authority | Per GDPR Article 33 requirements | Official notification form | Legal counsel |

**Information sharing rules:**
- Never share raw logs or evidence with external parties without legal approval
- Customer notifications use plain language, not technical jargon
- All external communications are reviewed by legal counsel before sending
- Incident details are not shared publicly until after resolution and post-mortem
