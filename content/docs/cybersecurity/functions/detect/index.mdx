title: "DE: Detect"
description: Find anomalies and adverse events through continuous monitoring and analysis.
---

Detect answers the question: **how do we know if something bad is happening?**

For each control implemented in [Protect](../protect), define how you would know if it fails or is bypassed. Detection turns controls from "trust me" into "prove it" — monitoring, alerting, and investigation procedures that surface problems before they escalate.

## Minimum coverage

Every control rated High or Critical severity must have at least one monitoring rule that would detect the control failing or being bypassed. Medium severity controls should have monitoring where feasible. Low severity controls can be covered by periodic review rather than real-time monitoring.

## Categories

| Category | ID | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| [Continuous Monitoring](./continuous-monitoring) | DE.CM | Ongoing monitoring of assets and operations |
| [Adverse Event Analysis](./adverse-event-analysis) | DE.AE | Correlating, analyzing, and investigating anomalies |

## When is Detect complete?

Detect is complete when:

1. Every High and Critical severity control has at least one monitoring rule defined (DE.CM)
2. Incident declaration criteria are defined — what conditions promote an anomaly to an incident (DE.AE)
3. Alert routing is configured so that each severity level reaches the right responder within the escalation SLA defined in [Respond](../respond)
