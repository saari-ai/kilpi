## Our methodology

Oversight is the feedback loop. Without it, the security posture drifts — controls go stale, accepted risks change in severity, and new threats emerge that existing controls do not cover.

### GV.OV-01: Review strategy outcomes

Review whether the risk management strategy is achieving its objectives and helping leadership make decisions. Adjust when it is not.

| Frequency | What is reviewed | Participants |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| *After each release* | *Pipeline results, bypassed checks, new dependencies* | *Engineering lead, security lead* |
| *Monthly* | *Open risk items, overdue remediations, trending metrics* | *Security lead, product owner* |
| *Quarterly* | *Control inventory vs. threat landscape, risk appetite validity* | *Security lead, product owner, leadership* |
| *Annually* | *Entire framework: context changes, compliance, strategy alignment* | *Leadership, security lead, product owner, engineering lead* |
| | | |

### GV.OV-02: Review and adjust strategy

Review the strategy when events demand it rather than waiting for the next scheduled cycle.

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| *Security incident* | *Update controls, adjust detection rules, conduct lessons learned* |
| *New feature or integration* | *Run through [Identify](/docs/cybersecurity/functions/identify) for the new surface area* |
| *New compliance requirement* | *Map to existing controls, identify gaps* |
| *Major infrastructure change* | *Validate existing controls apply or add new ones* |
| *Critical vulnerability disclosure* | *Patch or mitigate per [severity-action mapping](/docs/cybersecurity/functions/govern/risk-management-strategy)* |
| *Key person departure* | *Revoke access, reassign roles per [GV.RR](/docs/cybersecurity/functions/govern/roles-responsibilities)* |
| | |

### GV.OV-03: Performance evaluation

Track a small set of metrics that indicate whether the security posture is improving, stable, or degrading. Metrics are a signal, not a target — pair them with judgment.

| Metric | What it tells you |
|--------|-------------------|
| *Mean time to remediate (by severity)* | *How quickly you close findings — trending up is a problem* |
| *Open risk count by severity* | *Current exposure — stable or declining is the goal* |
| *Pipeline block rate* | *How often the pipeline catches issues — a sudden drop may mean checks are stale* |
| *Exception count and age* | *How many policy bypasses exist and how long they have been open* |
| *Time since last full review* | *Whether scheduled reviews are actually happening* |
