import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

Execute the methodology in this order:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Govern

Establish risk strategy, roles, policies, and oversight for the organisation.

See [Govern](/docs/cybersecurity/functions/govern).
</Step>

<Step>
### Component Register

Register the components you will assess.

See [Component Register](/docs/cybersecurity/templates/component-register).
</Step>

<Step>
### For each component, repeat

Work through every registered component and complete the following three functions for each one:

- **[Identify](/docs/cybersecurity/functions/identify)** — inventory assets, model threats (STRIDE), and score risks.
- **[Protect](/docs/cybersecurity/functions/protect)** — select and implement controls for each scored threat.
- **[Detect](/docs/cybersecurity/functions/detect)** — define monitoring rules and alert thresholds for each control.
</Step>

<Step>
### Respond

Build incident response playbooks and escalation paths.

See [Respond](/docs/cybersecurity/functions/respond).
</Step>

<Step>
### Recover

Define recovery plans and feedback loops.

See [Recover](/docs/cybersecurity/functions/recover).
</Step>
</Steps>

Steps 1, 2, 4, and 5 are **org-level** — do them once and all components inherit them. Step 3 is **per-component** — repeat it for each registered component. See [Scope](/docs/cybersecurity/scope) for detail.

For single-product startups where the organisation *is* the product team, run the org-level and component-level work simultaneously — there's no need to complete Govern in isolation before starting Identify.
