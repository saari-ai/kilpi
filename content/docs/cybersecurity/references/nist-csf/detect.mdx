## DE.AE: Adverse Event Analysis

*Anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other potentially adverse events are analyzed to characterize the events and detect cybersecurity incidents.*

### Subcategories

| ID | Outcome |
|----|---------|
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>DE.AE-02</span> | Potentially adverse events are analyzed to better understand associated activities |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>DE.AE-03</span> | Information is correlated from multiple sources |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>DE.AE-04</span> | The estimated impact and scope of adverse events are understood |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>DE.AE-06</span> | Information on adverse events is provided to authorized staff and tools |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>DE.AE-07</span> | Cyber threat intelligence and other contextual information are integrated into the analysis |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>DE.AE-08</span> | Incidents are declared when adverse events meet the defined incident criteria |

{/* Note: DE.AE numbering has gaps (01, 05) in CSF 2.0. */}

### Implementation examples
