title: Component Register
description: Register of components assessed under the Cybersecurity methodology
---

The Component Register is the bridge between organisational governance and per-component assessments. Every component that will receive an Identify, Protect, and Detect assessment must be listed here first. See [Scope](/docs/cybersecurity/scope#what-constitutes-a-component) for guidance on what constitutes a component.

### Definition of Done

- [ ] All components identified and listed in the register below
- [ ] Each component has a unique 2–4 letter code
- [ ] Owner assigned to every component
- [ ] Data classification and criticality rated for every component
- [ ] At least one component has a completed assessment

### Code conventions

Component codes appear as the middle segment of every artifact ID (e.g. `SA-TF-1`, `SC-TF-1`). Follow these rules:

- **2–4 uppercase letters.** No digits, no special characters.
- **Unique across the organisation.** No two components share a code.
- **Permanent.** Once assigned, a code is never reassigned to a different component — even if the original component is decommissioned.
