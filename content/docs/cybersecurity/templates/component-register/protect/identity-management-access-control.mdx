For methodology guidance, see [PR.AA: Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control](/docs/cybersecurity/functions/protect/identity-management-access-control).

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Every threat rated Medium or above in the threat register has at least one control mapped to it
- [ ] Every control has a unique ID (`SC-{component}-*`), a testable statement, and a mapped NIST subcategory
- [ ] Coverage checks pass for every data classification level present in the asset register
- [ ] Critical and High severity threats have controls with evidence of implementation (not just planned)
