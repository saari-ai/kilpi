### GV.SC-01: Supply chain risk management program <a data-external href="/docs/cybersecurity/functions/govern/supply-chain-risk#gvsc-01-supply-chain-risk-management-program"><SquareArrowOutUpRight size={14} /></a>

Establish a program with clear objectives for managing supply chain risk. State the program's objectives, scope, and how it integrates with the broader security strategy.

### GV.SC-02: Supply chain roles and responsibilities <a data-external href="/docs/cybersecurity/functions/govern/supply-chain-risk#gvsc-02-supply-chain-roles-and-responsibilities"><SquareArrowOutUpRight size={14} /></a>

Define who owns supply chain risk decisions internally, and what security expectations apply to suppliers, customers, and partners.

| Role | Supply chain responsibility |
|---|---|
| | |

---

### GV.SC-03: Enterprise risk integration <a data-external href="/docs/cybersecurity/functions/govern/supply-chain-risk#gvsc-03-enterprise-risk-integration"><SquareArrowOutUpRight size={14} /></a>

Ensure supply chain risks appear in the same risk management process as other cybersecurity and enterprise risks.

---

### GV.SC-04: Supplier inventory and criticality <a data-external href="/docs/cybersecurity/functions/govern/supply-chain-risk#gvsc-04-supplier-inventory-and-criticality"><SquareArrowOutUpRight size={14} /></a>

Maintain an inventory of all suppliers and dependencies, classified by the risk they pose.

| Supplier / dependency | Type | Criticality | Data access | Assessment frequency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | |

---

### GV.SC-05: Contractual requirements <a data-external href="/docs/cybersecurity/functions/govern/supply-chain-risk#gvsc-05-contractual-requirements"><SquareArrowOutUpRight size={14} /></a>

Include security requirements in contracts and agreements with suppliers.

| Requirement | Applies to |
|---|---|
| | |

---

### GV.SC-06: Pre-adoption due diligence <a data-external href="/docs/cybersecurity/functions/govern/supply-chain-risk#gvsc-06-pre-adoption-due-diligence"><SquareArrowOutUpRight size={14} /></a>

Assess supplier risk before entering a relationship.

| Criterion | What to evaluate |
|---|---|
| | |

---

### GV.SC-07: Ongoing supplier risk monitoring <a data-external href="/docs/cybersecurity/functions/govern/supply-chain-risk#gvsc-07-ongoing-supplier-risk-monitoring"><SquareArrowOutUpRight size={14} /></a>

Monitor suppliers throughout the relationship.

| Monitoring activity | Cadence |
|---|---|
| | |

---

### GV.SC-08: Supplier incident coordination <a data-external href="/docs/cybersecurity/functions/govern/supply-chain-risk#gvsc-08-supplier-incident-coordination"><SquareArrowOutUpRight size={14} /></a>

Include critical suppliers in incident planning. Document escalation contacts, communication protocols, and mutual notification commitments for each critical supplier.

---

### GV.SC-09: Build integrity and provenance <a data-external href="/docs/cybersecurity/functions/govern/supply-chain-risk#gvsc-09-build-integrity-and-provenance"><SquareArrowOutUpRight size={14} /></a>

Use SLSA to establish build integrity requirements per product.

| SLSA level | Requirement | Target for |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

---

### GV.SC-10: Relationship termination <a data-external href="/docs/cybersecurity/functions/govern/supply-chain-risk#gvsc-10-relationship-termination"><SquareArrowOutUpRight size={14} /></a>

Plan for the end of supplier relationships before they begin. When a relationship ends, revoke access immediately, verify data is returned or destroyed, rotate shared credentials, and replace any dependencies on the supplier's products.
