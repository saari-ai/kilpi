title: Overview
description: Devil's Advocate — a decision framework that shifts an agent's cognitive stance from cooperative to adversarial, forcing rigorous challenge of ideas before they become commitments
---

AI agents are naturally cooperative. They complete requests, agree with premises, and optimize for the answer the person seems to want. This is usually helpful — but it is dangerous when the person needs their thinking challenged, not confirmed.

The Devil's Advocate framework is a **perspective shift operator**. It changes the agent's default posture from "help build this idea" to "find where this idea breaks." It is not a domain skill — it produces no artifacts, templates, or checklists. It is a modifier that reshapes how an agent engages with any claim, plan, or decision.

## The strong version vs the weak version

There is a weak version of devil's advocacy: generic contrarianism. "Have you considered the opposite?" "What could go wrong?" This is easy to produce and almost useless. It makes people feel challenged without actually challenging anything.

The strong version is specific. It identifies:

- **Load-bearing assumptions** — which beliefs, if wrong, collapse the entire argument?
- **Specific failure mechanisms** — not "this might fail" but "this fails when X happens because Y"
- **Irreversible consequences** — which decisions, once made, cannot be undone?
- **Hidden dependencies** — what must be true for this to work that nobody has stated?

This framework produces the strong version. Every technique in it is designed to generate specific, actionable challenges — not vague concern.

## Composable by design

The Devil's Advocate framework is designed to combine with domain skills. On its own, it provides adversarial thinking patterns but no subject matter. Combined with a domain skill, it changes the agent's default posture:

- **Domain skill alone** — the agent produces answers. "Here is the architecture for your system."
- **Domain skill + Devil's Advocate** — the agent stress-tests before affirming. "Your architecture assumes the database handles 10k concurrent writes. What evidence do you have for that number, and what happens at 50k?"

The domain skill provides the **what**. Devil's Advocate provides the **challenge**. See [Composability](/docs/devils-advocate/composability) for the full model.

## The core loop

The framework operates through a six-step challenge process:

```
Analyze Context → Extract Claim → Identify Assumptions → Stress-Test → Model Consequences → Synthesize
  ↑                                                                                            |
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**[Analyze Context](/docs/devils-advocate/context)** — Read the decision landscape. What are the stakes? How reversible is this? How much uncertainty exists? How emotionally invested is the person?

**Extract Claim** — Identify the core assertion being made. Strip away framing and narrative to find the actual claim that needs testing.

**Identify Assumptions** — Surface the beliefs that the claim depends on. What must be true for this to work? What has been assumed without evidence?

**[Stress-Test](/docs/devils-advocate/modes)** — Apply the appropriate adversarial mode. Challenge the assumptions through structured techniques — not random objections.

**Model Consequences** — Trace the implications of failure. If this assumption is wrong, what happens? How bad is the downside? How quickly would you know?

**Synthesize** — Always end with synthesis, not a pile of concerns. What survives the challenge? What needs more evidence? What should change? The goal is a stronger decision, not paralysis.

This loop runs continuously through an interaction. It is not something the agent announces — it is the internal process that governs engagement.

> [!WARNING] **The biggest risk**
>
> Producing generic contrarianism that makes people feel challenged without actually improving their thinking. The strong version requires specificity — naming the exact assumption, the exact failure mode, the exact consequence. If the challenge could apply to any idea, it is too weak.
