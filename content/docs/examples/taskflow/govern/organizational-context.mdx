### GV.OC-01: Organizational mission

Taskflow provides project management for small-to-medium teams. Uptime and data integrity are core to the value proposition. Teams rely on Taskflow to coordinate daily work, so any outage or data corruption directly impacts their ability to deliver.

### GV.OC-02: Stakeholder identification

| Stakeholder | Type | Expectations | Security requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| Customers (team admins) | External | Project data is private, available, and not used outside the product | Data encryption at rest and in transit, tenant isolation, 99.9% uptime SLA |
| End users | External | Personal data handled responsibly, sessions are secure | GDPR compliance, secure session management, password protection |
| Enterprise procurement | External | SOC 2 Type II and GDPR compliance evidence during evaluation | Audit trails, access controls, documented security policies |
| Stripe | Partner | PCI DSS compliance for payment integration | Webhook signature validation, API key protection, no card data storage |
| Engineering team | Internal | Clear security requirements, no surprise audit findings | Documented policies, automated enforcement in CI |

### GV.OC-03: Compliance landscape

| Obligation | Type | Products affected | Key requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| GDPR | Regulatory | All (EU users) | Lawful basis for processing, data subject rights, breach notification within 72 hours, DPA with sub-processors |
| PCI DSS | Regulatory | Billing features | No storage of card data (delegated to Stripe), API key protection, webhook integrity |
| SOC 2 Type II | Contractual | All (enterprise customers) | Access controls, audit logging, incident response, change management |
| CAN-SPAM / GDPR email | Regulatory | Email notifications | Unsubscribe mechanism, sender authentication (SPF/DKIM via SendGrid) |

### GV.OC-04: Critical capabilities and services

| Layer | Owns | Example responsibilities | Criticality |
|---|---|---|---|
| Application | Taskflow engineering | React SPA, Express API, business logic, auth flows | Critical |

| Dependency | What it provides | Impact if unavailable | Blast radius if compromised | Security contact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, ElastiCache) | All infrastructure | Complete service outage | Full data exposure, infrastructure takeover | AWS Support / TAM |
| Stripe | Payment processing | Users cannot upgrade, downgrade, or start new subscriptions | Unauthorized charges, refund fraud, payment data exposure | Stripe support + dashboard |
| SendGrid | Email delivery | No password reset emails, no notifications | Phishing emails from Taskflow domain | SendGrid support |
| Google OAuth | Social login | Users relying on Google login cannot authenticate | Token theft, account impersonation | Google Cloud support |
| npm registry | Package distribution | Cannot build or deploy | Supply chain attack, RCE via malicious package | GitHub Security Advisories |
