description: Taskflow example for roles, responsibilities, and authorities
---

For methodology guidance, see [GV.RR: Roles, Responsibilities, and Authorities](/docs/functions/govern/roles-responsibilities).

Taskflow is a small team. Roles overlap -- one person may hold multiple roles. What matters is that each responsibility has a named owner.

---

### GV.RR-01: Leadership accountability

The CTO is ultimately accountable for Taskflow's security posture. The CTO delegates operational security decisions to the security lead (backend lead) but retains authority over risk acceptance for Critical-severity items and budget allocation for security tooling.

---

### GV.RR-02: Roles and responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Security lead (backend lead) | Reviews threat register quarterly. Approves changes to control inventory. Owns incident response coordination. Final decision on risk acceptance for High and below. | Can block releases for security reasons. Can mandate control implementation timelines. |
| Infrastructure owner (backend lead or DevOps) | Manages cloud configuration (VPC, S3 policies, Redis network rules). Responsible for secret rotation. Verifies infrastructure controls match documented posture. | Can modify production infrastructure. Can rotate credentials without approval. |
| Application security (all developers) | Follows secure coding practices (parameterised queries, output encoding, schema validation). Flags security-relevant changes in PRs for security lead review. | Can reject PRs for security violations. |
| Incident responder (on-call engineer) | First responder for security alerts. Executes playbooks from the [Respond](/docs/examples/taskflow/respond) function. Escalates to security lead if severity is High or Critical. | Can block IPs, disable endpoints, flush sessions during active incidents. |
| Dependency maintainer (designated developer) | Monitors Dependabot / scanning alerts. Triages and patches critical CVEs within SLA. Reports blocked dependencies to security lead. | Can merge dependency update PRs without feature review. |

---

### GV.RR-03: Resource allocation

| Resource type | Allocation | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Engineering time | 10% of each sprint reserved for security work | Covers dependency updates, control verification, threat register maintenance |
| Security tooling | Budget for Gitleaks, Dependabot (free), AWS CloudTrail, log aggregation | Automation reduces manual review burden and catches issues CI can enforce |
| Training | 1 day per quarter for security-focused learning | Keeps team current on OWASP Top 10, new attack patterns, framework updates |
| Incident response | On-call rotation with 15-minute response SLA for Critical alerts | Ensures incidents are handled promptly regardless of business hours |

---

### GV.RR-04: Human resources practices

| HR event | Security action |
|---|---|
| New hire onboarding | Grant least-privilege access. Security policy briefing. Add to relevant alert channels. |
| Role change | Review and adjust access permissions. Update roles table above. |
| Offboarding | Revoke all access within 1 hour. Rotate any shared credentials the person had access to. Remove from alert channels and on-call rotation. |
| Contractor engagement | Scoped access only. No production database access. NDA required. Access reviewed monthly. |

Accountability for security outcomes is documented and accepted by each role holder. Adequate resources (time, tooling, training) are allocated for each role.
