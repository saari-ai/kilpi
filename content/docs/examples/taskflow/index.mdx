title: Taskflow Example
description: A worked example applying the CSF methodology to a real product
---

Taskflow is a fictional SaaS project management tool used as a worked example across all six NIST CSF 2.0 functions. It has a React SPA, Express API, PostgreSQL, Redis, S3, and integrations with Stripe and SendGrid -- enough surface area to exercise the full methodology.

The purpose of this example is to show how the CSF methodology produces concrete, traceable security artefacts for a real product. Every threat maps to an asset. Every control maps to a threat. Every monitoring rule maps to a control. Every response playbook maps to a detection trigger. And every subcategory ID ties the whole chain back to the NIST CSF 2.0 framework.

Each function below is broken into its NIST CSF 2.0 categories, with every subcategory filled in with Taskflow-specific data.

| Function | Categories |
|---|---|
| [Govern](/docs/examples/taskflow/govern) | Organizational context, risk strategy, roles, policy, oversight, and supply chain risk |
| [Identify](/docs/examples/taskflow/identify) | Asset management, risk assessment, and improvement |
| [Protect](/docs/examples/taskflow/protect) | Access control, training, data security, platform security, and resilience |
| [Detect](/docs/examples/taskflow/detect) | Continuous monitoring and adverse event analysis |
| [Respond](/docs/examples/taskflow/respond) | Incident management, analysis, reporting, and mitigation |
| [Recover](/docs/examples/taskflow/recover) | Recovery plan execution and recovery communication |

## The traceability chain

The example demonstrates a full traceability chain across NIST CSF 2.0:

```
Asset (ID.AM) → Threat (ID.RA) → Control (PR.*) → Monitoring (DE.*) → Response (RS.*) → Recovery (RC.*)
```

Every table in the category pages includes references to the specific asset IDs (SA-TF-*), threat IDs (ST-TF-*), and control IDs (SC-TF-*) that connect the chain. This is the mechanism that connects product-level security work to the framework.
