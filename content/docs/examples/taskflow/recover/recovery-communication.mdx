### RC.CO-03: Internal and stakeholder recovery updates

**Internal update cadence:**

| Severity | Update frequency | Who receives |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | Every 2 hours during active recovery, then daily until closure | Engineering team, security lead, CTO, legal counsel |
| High | Daily during active recovery, then at resolution | Engineering team, security lead |
| Medium | At resolution only | Engineering team lead |

**External stakeholder notifications:**

| Stakeholder | What to communicate | Channel |
|---|---|---|
| Affected users (credential compromise) | Credentials have been rotated. Password reset required. What data was at risk and for how long. Steps taken to prevent recurrence. | Email (direct to affected users) |
| Affected users (session hijacking) | Sessions were terminated for security reasons. Password reset recommended. Exposure window and what was at risk. | Email (direct to affected users) |
| Affected users (data exposure) | What data was accessible, to whom, and for how long. Steps taken to secure the data. Regulatory notification status. | Email (direct to affected users) |
| Affected users (XSS / injection) | If sessions were compromised or data was modified, specific guidance on what to check and what actions to take. | Email (direct to affected users) |
| Stripe | Confirmation that old API keys are revoked. Report on any unauthorized charges found. | Stripe dashboard support |
| SendGrid | Confirmation that old API keys are revoked. Report on any unauthorized emails sent. | SendGrid support |
| Supervisory authority (GDPR) | Per Article 33: nature of breach, data categories, approximate user count, consequences, measures taken. | Official notification form |

**Recovery-specific communication by incident type:**

- **Credential compromise**: Notify affected users that credentials have been rotated. For API key compromises, confirm with Stripe/SendGrid that old keys are revoked. Update internal stakeholders on recovery status and timeline.
- **Session hijacking**: Notify affected users that sessions were terminated for security reasons. If hijacking was confirmed, provide guidance on password resets. Internal report on exposure window and network configuration changes.
- **Data exposure**: If user data or files were accessed, notify affected users per legal requirements. Communicate timeline of exposure and what data categories were affected. Document configuration changes and new controls.
- **Application attack**: If data was exfiltrated or modified, notify affected users. If XSS compromised sessions, notify those users specifically. Internal post-mortem documenting attack vector and new prevention measures.
- **Dependency compromise**: For RCE-level compromises, communicate full scope of recovery (server rebuild, secret rotation, data verification). Internal: update dependency management procedures and scanning frequency.

### RC.CO-04: Public updates

| Update stage | Channel | Content | Approval |
|---|---|---|---|
| Initial acknowledgement | Status page (if applicable) | "We are investigating a security issue. Service may be intermittently affected." | Incident lead |
| Impact confirmed | Status page + email to all users (if broad impact) | "We identified a security issue affecting [scope]. We have contained the issue and are working on full resolution." | CTO + legal |
| Resolution | Status page + email to affected users | "The security issue has been resolved. [Summary of what happened, what we did, what you should do]." | CTO + legal |
| Post-mortem (internal) | Internal documentation + team briefing | Full technical details, timeline, root cause, action items | Security lead |

Public communications are always reviewed by legal counsel before publication. No technical details about the vulnerability are shared publicly until the fix is deployed and verified.
