title: Welcome to fiksu
description: Agent skills backed by robust methodology.
---

fiksu is a documentation site — methodologies, frameworks, and domain knowledge structured for both humans and AI agents. Skills are the code that brings this knowledge to life. See [Anatomy of a Discipline](/docs/fiksu/anatomy-of-a-discipline) for how disciplines are structured, and [Anatomy of a Skill](/docs/fiksu/anatomy-of-a-skill) for how skills use them.

## Agent agnostic

fiksu is a general capabilities library. The methodologies and frameworks here are not tied to any specific AI agent or tool. They can be mapped to different sub-agents and platforms — Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, or any agent that can consume structured knowledge. The disciplines provide the _what_; the target agent determines the _how_.

A packaging layer will compile fiksu capabilities into agent-specific formats — Claude skills, Cursor rules, or whatever a given platform requires. You author once in fiksu's universal format; the packager outputs the right shape for each target.

## Capability levels

Capabilities in fiksu exist at two levels, similar to the extension model in Orch:

- **Extension-level capabilities** — packaged by vendors or the community, these are curated skill sets that ship as part of a tool or platform. They provide domain expertise out of the box.
- **User-level capabilities** — created and customised by individual users or teams. These let you add your own methodologies, adapt existing ones, or layer domain knowledge specific to your context.

Extension-level capabilities give you a strong starting point. User-level capabilities let you make it yours.
