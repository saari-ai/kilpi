title: The Solopreneur
description: Why fiksu exists — everyone is becoming a solopreneur.

The line between "business owner" and "employee" is dissolving. Whether you're founding a company from your kitchen table or leading a function inside a thousand-person organisation, the expectation is the same: own the outcome end-to-end.

You're expected to understand your customers, secure your systems, manage your finances, ship reliable software, hire and develop people — all at once. The job title says one thing; the reality says solopreneur.

This isn't a future trend. It's already here. Teams are smaller. Budgets are tighter. AI is removing the excuse that you need a department for every discipline. One person with the right capabilities can now do what used to require a room full of specialists.

## The problem

Breadth without depth is dangerous. A founder who ships fast but ignores security gets breached. A CTO who writes beautiful code but can't validate a product wastes years building the wrong thing. A parent who optimises for career but neglects presence at home pays a different kind of cost.

The solopreneur doesn't need to be an expert in everything — but they need to be competent in everything that matters. And "everything that matters" keeps growing.

## Where fiksu fits

fiksu gives you capabilities. Not courses to complete or books to read — structured, actionable knowledge that you and your AI agents can use in the moment you need it.

Need to run a security assessment on a new feature? There's a capability for that. Need to frame a product problem before building? There's a capability for that. Need to think through a hard decision with an adversarial lens? There's a capability for that too.

Each capability encodes a methodology — the kind of thinking that used to live inside a specialist's head. fiksu makes it accessible to anyone willing to use it, amplified by agents that can apply it alongside you.

## The bet

The solopreneur era rewards people who can operate across disciplines without cutting corners. fiksu is a bet that the right capabilities, structured the right way, make that possible.
