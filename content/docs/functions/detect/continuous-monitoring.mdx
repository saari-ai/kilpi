## Our methodology

Continuous monitoring starts from the controls defined in [Protect](../protect). For each control, ask: what would I see if this control failed or was bypassed? That observable signal is what you monitor.

### DE.CM-01: Network monitoring

Define monitoring rules for network-level signals. For cloud-native products without traditional network perimeters, focus on API gateway logs, load balancer metrics, and service mesh telemetry.

| What to monitor | Method | Alert threshold |
|---|---|---|
| *e.g. DNS queries* | *DNS log analysis* | *Queries to known-malicious domains, tunneling patterns* |
| *e.g. Connection patterns* | *Flow comparison against baseline* | *Unexpected outbound connections, unusual ports* |
| *e.g. Service availability* | *Health checks, synthetic probes* | *Service unreachable or degraded* |
| | | |

### DE.CM-02: Physical environment monitoring

Define monitoring for physical access and environmental controls. For cloud-hosted products, document which physical monitoring your provider handles and what gaps remain in your own facilities.

| What to monitor | Method | Alert threshold |
|---|---|---|
| *e.g. Office access* | *Badge reader logs* | *Access outside business hours, failed attempts* |
| *e.g. Server room* | *Environmental sensors, cameras* | *Temperature spike, unauthorized entry* |
| | | |

### DE.CM-03: Personnel activity monitoring

Monitor authentication events and access patterns to detect insider threats and compromised accounts. Focus on deviations from normal behaviour, not surveillance.

| What to monitor | Method | Alert threshold |
|---|---|---|
| *e.g. Authentication* | *Login event analysis* | *Brute force patterns, impossible travel, concurrent sessions* |
| *e.g. Access patterns* | *Behavioural analytics* | *Bulk downloads, access to unfamiliar resources* |
| *e.g. Privilege usage* | *Admin action audit logs* | *Elevated privilege use outside change windows* |
| | | |

### DE.CM-06: External service provider monitoring

When you depend on external services, you inherit their risk. Track provider activity on your systems and watch for behavioural deviations from expected norms.

| What to monitor | Method | Alert threshold |
|---|---|---|
| *e.g. Cloud provider status* | *Status page integration, alerts* | *Degradation of services you depend on* |
| *e.g. Third-party admin actions* | *Audit logs for external providers* | *Any administrative action on your systems* |
| *e.g. Managed service traffic* | *Traffic pattern analysis* | *Deviation from expected norms* |
| | | |

### DE.CM-09: Application and runtime monitoring

This is the most product-specific category. Define monitoring rules for application logs, runtime environments, and software configuration drift. Each product should map its controls from [Protect](../protect) to observable signals.

| What to monitor | Method | Alert threshold |
|---|---|---|
| *e.g. Auth events* | *Structured application logging* | *Failed login spikes, credential reuse* |
| *e.g. Runtime environment* | *Container integrity checks* | *Unexpected process execution, file system changes* |
| *e.g. Config drift* | *Baseline comparison* | *Unauthorized changes to security config* |
| *e.g. Dependencies* | *CVE scanning* | *Any critical or high CVE* |
