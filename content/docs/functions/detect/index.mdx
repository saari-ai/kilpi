description: Find anomalies and adverse events through continuous monitoring and analysis.

Detect answers the question: **how do we know if something bad is happening?**

For each control implemented in [Protect](../protect), define how you would know if it fails or is bypassed. Detection turns controls from "trust me" into "prove it" — monitoring, alerting, and investigation procedures that surface problems before they escalate.
