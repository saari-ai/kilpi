title: "GV: Govern"
description: Establish strategy, expectations, and policy that inform all other security functions.
---

Govern wraps all five operational functions. It establishes the risk tolerance, roles, policies, and oversight cadence that every other function depends on. Without Govern, the rest of the framework has no anchor — controls exist without context, incidents get handled without process, and reviews don't happen.

For a small team, this doesn't mean bureaucracy. It means decisions are written down, roles are clear, and the program gets reviewed as the system grows.
