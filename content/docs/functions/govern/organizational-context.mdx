## Our methodology

Organizational context answers the question: what are we protecting, why does it matter, and who cares? Everything else in the security framework depends on getting this right. If you skip context, you end up securing the wrong things at the wrong level.

### GV.OC-01: Organizational mission

Share the organization's mission (e.g., through vision and mission statements, marketing, and service strategies) to provide a basis for identifying risks that may impede that mission.

State the mission in plain language: what the organization does, who it serves, and what outcomes matter most. This becomes the lens for every risk decision that follows — if a risk doesn't threaten the mission, it's lower priority.

### GV.OC-02: Stakeholder identification

List the people and groups who have expectations about your security posture, what they expect, and what security requirements those expectations create. These become inputs to [Risk Management Strategy](/docs/functions/govern/risk-management-strategy) and [Policy](/docs/functions/govern/policy).

| Stakeholder | Type | Expectations | Security requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| *e.g. Leadership* | *Internal* | *Risk stays within appetite, no regulatory penalties* | *Risk reporting cadence, escalation thresholds* |
| *e.g. Customers* | *External* | *Data privacy, service availability, breach notification* | *Encryption, SLA targets, incident comms plan* |
| *e.g. Regulators* | *External* | *Compliance with applicable laws* | *GDPR data handling, audit evidence* |
| | | | |

### GV.OC-03: Compliance landscape

Identify the legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations that apply to each product. This is not a one-time exercise — revisit when you enter new markets, take on new customers, or change what data you process.

This feeds directly into the control selection process under [Protect](/docs/functions/protect).

| Obligation | Type | Products affected | Key requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| *e.g. GDPR* | *Regulation* | *All products handling EU user data* | *Lawful basis, data subject rights, breach notification within 72h* |
| *e.g. SOC 2* | *Industry standard* | *All customer-facing products* | *Trust service criteria, annual audit* |
| *e.g. Customer DPA* | *Contractual* | *Enterprise tier* | *Data residency, subprocessor approval, deletion on termination* |
| | | | |

### GV.OC-04: Critical capabilities and services

Define the boundary between what you control and what others control. You cannot threat-model something until you know what you own. When a threat sits at the boundary between layers, document who owns the mitigation. Ambiguity at layer boundaries is where things fall through the cracks.

| Layer | Owns | Example responsibilities | Criticality |
|---|---|---|---|
| *e.g. Cloud provider* | *Physical infrastructure, hypervisor, managed service internals* | *Data centre security, hardware lifecycle, network backbone* | *High — single point of failure for all services* |
| *e.g. Platform* | *Everything built on top of cloud primitives* | *Container isolation, identity, control plane, network policy, secrets* | *High — compromise affects all products* |
| *e.g. Customer* | *Their own code, data, configuration* | *Application logic, auth decisions, data classification* | *Varies by customer tier* |
| | | | |

### GV.OC-05: Dependencies

Document the external services and resources your products depend on. Dependencies are a direct input to supply chain risk management under [GV.SC](/docs/functions/govern/supply-chain-risk) and to business continuity planning under [Recover](/docs/functions/recover).

| Dependency | What it provides | Impact if unavailable | Blast radius if compromised | Security contact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *e.g. AWS us-east-1* | *Compute, storage, networking* | *Full outage* | *All data at risk* | *AWS support + TAM* |
| *e.g. Stripe* | *Payment processing* | *Cannot process payments* | *Payment data exposure* | *security@stripe.com* |
| *e.g. SendGrid* | *Transactional email* | *No email notifications* | *Phishing via spoofed sender* | *SendGrid support* |
