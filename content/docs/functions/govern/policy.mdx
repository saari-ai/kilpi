## Our methodology

The security pipeline IS the policy. Automated enforcement means policy is followed by default, not by choice. The written document describes intent and rationale; the pipeline implements and enforces it.

### GV.PO-01: Establish and enforce policy

Create a security policy that is short, readable, and enforced through automation. Structure it around these sections:

| Section | Content | Draws from |
|---------|---------|------------|
| *Scope* | *What systems, data, and people the policy applies to* | *[Organizational Context](/docs/functions/govern/organizational-context)* |
| *Risk approach* | *Risk appetite and how risk is measured* | *[Risk Management Strategy](/docs/functions/govern/risk-management-strategy)* |
| *Roles* | *Who is responsible for what* | *[Roles and Responsibilities](/docs/functions/govern/roles-responsibilities)* |
| *Controls* | *What controls are required and how they are verified* | *[Protect](/docs/functions/protect)* |
| *Incident response* | *What happens when something goes wrong* | *[Respond](/docs/functions/respond)* |
| *Acceptable use* | *Expectations for interacting with systems, data, and credentials* | |
| *Exceptions* | *How to request and document exceptions* | |

Where possible, express policy rules as pipeline checks: version-controlled, testable, auditable, and consistent.

### GV.PO-02: Policy review and update

Review and update policy when the environment changes. Policy is not static.

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| *New regulation or compliance requirement* | *Review scope, update controls, adjust pipeline rules* |
| *New product or service* | *Extend scope, run through [Identify](/docs/functions/identify) for the new surface* |
| *Technology change* | *Review whether existing controls cover the new stack* |
| *Post-incident findings* | *Update policy to address gaps the incident revealed* |
| *Periodic review (at least annually)* | *Review entire policy for relevance* |
