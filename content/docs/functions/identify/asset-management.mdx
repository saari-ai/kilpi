title: "ID.AM: Asset Management"
description: Inventory and manage the assets that enable business purposes, consistent with their relative importance and risk.
---

Assets (data, hardware, software, systems, facilities, services, people) that enable the organization to achieve business purposes are identified and managed consistent with their relative importance to organizational objectives and the organization's risk strategy.

## Our methodology

You cannot threat-model something until you know what you own. Asset Management is the foundation — everything in [Risk Assessment](./risk-assessment) and [Protect](../protect) depends on having a clear inventory of what exists, who owns it, and how important it is.

---

### ID.AM-01: Hardware inventory

List all hardware managed by the organization. Include servers, networking equipment, endpoints, IoT devices, and anything else with a network presence.

| Asset | Type | Location | Owner | Criticality |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *e.g. Production k8s nodes* | *Server* | *AWS us-east-1* | *Platform team* | *Critical* |
| *e.g. Office access points* | *Networking* | *HQ* | *IT ops* | *Medium* |
| | | | | |

---

### ID.AM-02: Software and services inventory

List all software, services, and systems managed by the organization. Include applications, container images, APIs, and cloud services you build or operate.

| Asset | Type | Owner | Data classification | Criticality |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *e.g. API gateway* | *Service* | *Platform team* | *Confidential* | *Critical* |
| *e.g. Admin dashboard* | *Application* | *Product team* | *Internal* | *High* |
| | | | | |

### ID.AM-03: Network data flows

Document authorized network communication paths and data flows, both internal and external. Architectural diagrams (produced by architecture, annotated by security during Identify) serve as the primary representation. These should show external actors, services, data stores, trust boundaries, data flow direction, and classification labels on flows carrying confidential or restricted data.

See the [Component Template](/docs/templates/component) for the full list of what security needs on the diagrams.

### ID.AM-04: Supplier services

Inventory all external services your products depend on: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, APIs, and externally hosted applications. Update the inventory when a new external service is introduced.

| Supplier | Service | Data processed | Authorized by | Trust level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *e.g. AWS* | *Compute, storage* | *All production data* | *CTO* | *High* |
| *e.g. SendGrid* | *Transactional email* | *Email addresses, notification content* | *Engineering lead* | *Medium* |
| | | | | |

### ID.AM-05: Asset prioritization

Prioritize assets based on classification, criticality, and impact on the mission. Define criteria for each asset class and apply them consistently. Update priorities when significant changes occur.

| Classification | Definition |
|---|---|
| Public | No impact if exposed. Marketing pages, open-source code. |
| Internal | Low impact if exposed. Internal tooling, non-sensitive config. |
| Confidential | Material impact if exposed. User data, business data, API keys. |
| Restricted | Severe impact if exposed. Credentials, payment data, encryption keys. |

| Criticality | Definition |
|---|---|
| Low | Loss or compromise has minimal operational impact. |
| Medium | Loss or compromise causes degraded service or limited data exposure. |
| High | Loss or compromise causes significant disruption or data exposure. |
| Critical | Loss or compromise causes platform-wide impact, multi-tenant breach, or regulatory violation. |

### ID.AM-07: Data inventory

Maintain an inventory of designated data types and their metadata. Assign data classifications through tags or labels and track provenance, data owner, and geolocation.

| Data type | Classification | Owner | Storage location | Retention |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *e.g. User PII* | *Confidential* | *Product team* | *Primary database, backups* | *Account lifetime + 30 days* |
| *e.g. API keys* | *Restricted* | *Platform team* | *Secrets manager* | *Rotated quarterly* |
| | | | | |

---

### ID.AM-08: Lifecycle management

Track assets from deployment through retirement. Integrate security considerations before production deployment, identify shadow IT and redundant systems that increase attack surface, and securely destroy or sanitize data when hardware or services are retired.

| Asset | Lifecycle stage | Last reviewed | Next action | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *e.g. Legacy auth service* | *Scheduled for retirement* | *2025-01* | *Migrate users by Q2, decommission* | *Platform team* |
| *e.g. New billing service* | *Pre-deployment* | *2025-02* | *Security review before production* | *Product team* |
| | | | | |
