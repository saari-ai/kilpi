Identify answers the question: **what do we have, and what could go wrong?**

Before selecting controls or building anything, classify what a change touches — what data, what trust boundaries, what assets, what attack surface. Every change runs through Identify first. The outputs (asset register, data flow diagram, threat model) are the primary inputs for [Protect](../protect).

The function covers three categories. Use the [Component Template](/docs/templates/component) to apply them to a specific system.

## Categories

| Category | ID | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| [Asset Management](./asset-management) | ID.AM | Inventories, scope, data classification |
| [Risk Assessment](./risk-assessment) | ID.RA | Threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, impact |
| [Improvement](./improvement) | ID.IM | Feedback loops from all functions back into improvements |
