description: The six NIST CSF 2.0 functions that organize our security methodology

CSF organizes cybersecurity outcomes into six functions. Govern sits at the centre, establishing risk management strategy and policy. The remaining five form a lifecycle: know what you have, protect it, watch for attacks, respond to incidents, recover.
