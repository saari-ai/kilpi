description: Turn threats into controls. Every scored threat from Identify traces to a testable safeguard.

Protect turns threats into controls. The primary input is the scored threat register from [Identify](../identify) — every threat gets a control, every control gets evidence, and the trace is documented end-to-end.

## From threats to controls

The process follows five steps:

1. **Gather threats** — read the scored threats from Identify. Severity determines priority.
2. **Select controls per threat** — for each threat, write a testable control statement. The threat describes the attack mechanism; the control is what prevents it.
3. **Map to subcategories** — assign each control to the appropriate PR category below. This confirms coverage and catches gaps.
4. **Prioritize by severity** — Critical and High threats drive the controls that block shipping. Medium and Low are tracked with target dates.
5. **Verify coverage** — scan the completeness check against your classification results. If the product handles sensitive data but no control addresses encryption, something was missed.
