title: "RC: Recover"
description: Restore capabilities after an incident and feed lessons back into the framework.
---

Recover answers the question: **how do we get back to normal, and what did we learn?**

After [Respond](../respond) contains an incident, Recover follows a specific sequence: restore from a known-good state, verify controls are back in place, run a post-mortem, and update the framework based on what was learned.

## Feedback loop

Recovery is where the framework closes its loop. Every incident teaches something about the system's real threat landscape. The post-mortem feeds directly back into [Identify](../identify):

- Update asset registers if scope changed
- Update threat models with the attack that actually happened
- Update risk scores based on real-world likelihood
- Update controls in [Protect](../protect) to address gaps the incident exposed
- Update detection rules in [Detect](../detect) to catch this class of event earlier
