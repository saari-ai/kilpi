## Our methodology

Incident management is the coordination layer — it makes sure the right people are involved, the incident is understood well enough to act on, and decisions are made in the right order. When [Detect](../detect) declares an incident, this is the first process that kicks in.

### RS.MA-01: Plan activation

Assign an incident lead, activate the relevant playbook, engage third parties if needed, and notify stakeholders. The incident lead is the single point of accountability for status, decisions, and communications.

| Step | Action | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| *1. Assign lead* | *Designate incident lead* | *On-call manager* |
| *2. Activate plan* | *Pull up playbook for incident type* | *Incident lead* |
| *3. Engage third parties* | *Contact external IR, legal, forensics if needed* | *Incident lead* |
| *4. Notify stakeholders* | *Follow escalation matrix* | *Incident lead* |
| | | |

### RS.MA-02: Incident triage

Validate the incident is real and estimate severity. Triage should take minutes, not hours — the goal is "good enough to prioritize," not "fully understood."

| Triage step | Question to answer | Output |
|---|---|---|
| *Validate* | *Is this a genuine incident or a false positive?* | *Confirmed / rejected* |
| *Estimate severity* | *How urgent is this?* | *Critical / High / Medium / Low* |
| *Scope check* | *What systems, data, and users are affected?* | *Preliminary scope statement* |
| | | |

### RS.MA-03: Categorization and prioritization

Categorize the incident by type and prioritize by scope, impact, and time sensitivity. Priority determines resource allocation — a critical incident gets all available responders.

| Incident type | Scope | Impact | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| *e.g. Data breach* | *Customer database* | *PII exposure, regulatory reporting* | *Critical* |
| *e.g. Account compromise* | *Single admin account* | *Potential lateral movement* | *High* |
| *e.g. DDoS* | *Public API* | *Service degradation* | *High* |
| | | | |

### RS.MA-04: Escalation

Escalation decisions should be predefined, not improvised during an incident. The incident lead is responsible for re-escalating when the situation changes.

| Severity | Escalate to | Timeline | Trigger for re-escalation |
|---|---|---|---|
| *Critical* | *Leadership + affected parties* | *Immediately* | *Any scope expansion* |
| *High* | *Team lead* | *Within 1 hour* | *Data impact confirmed* |
| *Medium* | *Incident log* | *Next business day* | *Scope expands beyond initial assessment* |
| *Low* | *Incident log* | *Next review cycle* | *Severity increases* |
| | | | |

### RS.MA-05: Recovery initiation criteria

The decision to initiate recovery is deliberate, not automatic. Before starting recovery, confirm containment is complete and weigh investigation needs against business impact. When criteria are met, hand off to [Recover](../recover).

| Criterion | Check | Status |
|---|---|---|
| *Attacker access removed* | *Containment and eradication confirmed* | *Yes / No* |
| *Investigation preserved* | *Forensic evidence captured before restoration* | *Yes / No* |
| *Business impact assessed* | *Cost of continued downtime vs. investigation thoroughness* | *Acceptable / Not yet* |
