description: Take action on detected incidents with pre-defined playbooks and escalation paths.

Respond answers the question: **what do we do when detection fires?**

The goal is to have decisions made before an incident, not during one. When an alert triggers from [Detect](../detect), the response follows a pre-defined playbook — who gets notified, what gets contained, and how the incident is escalated based on severity.

## Escalation matrix

Severity scores from the threat register determine the response urgency:

| Severity | Response | Escalation |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Critical | Immediate containment. All hands. | Notify leadership and affected parties within defined SLA. |
| High | Containment within hours. Dedicated responder. | Notify team lead. External notification if data affected. |
| Medium | Investigate within defined timeframe. | Track in incident log. Escalate if scope expands. |
| Low | Log and review in next cycle. | No immediate escalation. |
