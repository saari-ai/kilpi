Kilpi is a standalone security methodology built on NIST CSF 2.0. It can be adopted by any organisation. It provides the structure, conventions, and operational guidance needed to run a traceable, outcome-driven security program.

## Foundation

Kilpi uses the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 as its organizing structure. CSF defines **what** outcomes to achieve. Kilpi defines **how** we achieve them. The framework organizes outcomes into three tiers:

```
Function (6)
  └─ Category (22 total)
      └─ Subcategory (106 total)
```

<Image src="/diagrams/kilpi-govern.png" alt="Kilpi — Govern wraps Identify, Protect, Recover, and Respond" width={280} height={280} style={{maxWidth: '280px', height: 'auto'}} />

Govern sits at the centre. The remaining five functions form a lifecycle: know what you have (Identify), protect it (Protect), watch for attacks (Detect), act on incidents (Respond), get back to normal (Recover).

## Scope

Kilpi operates at two levels. See [Scope](/docs/scope) for detail.

| Level | Functions covered | Template |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| Organisation | All 6: GV, ID, PR, DE, RS, RC | [Template (Org)](/docs/templates/complete) |
| Component | ID, PR, DE only (inherits GV, RS, RC from org) | [Template (Component)](/docs/templates/component) |

## Profiles

NIST CSF uses Profiles to describe an organisation's security posture at a point in time. A completed Kilpi template is your **Current Profile** — it documents which subcategory outcomes you achieve today.

If you need to prioritise, create a **Target Profile** by marking each subcategory as in-scope or out-of-scope based on your risk appetite and business objectives. The gap between Current and Target drives investment decisions.

## Techniques

Kilpi uses established techniques at specific points in the methodology:

| Technique | Used in | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **STRIDE** | Identify (ID.RA) | Threat identification — classify threats by Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege |
| **MITRE ATT&CK** | Identify (ID.RA) | Attack validation — map identified threats to known adversary tactics and techniques |
| **Likelihood x Impact** | Identify (ID.RA) | Risk scoring — combine likelihood and impact into a severity rating that drives priority |

## Traceability

Every security artifact traces through a chain across functions:

```
Asset (ID.AM)
  → Threat (ID.RA)
    → Control (PR.*)
      → Monitoring (DE.*)
        → Response (RS.*)
          → Recovery (RC.*)
```

ID schemes keep artifacts traceable. See [Conventions](/docs/conventions) for the full scheme.

| Prefix | Artifact | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| SA- | Asset | SA-TF-1 |
| ST- | Threat | ST-TF-1 |
| SC- | Control | SC-AA-1 |

## Functions

The methodology pages live under [Functions](/docs/functions). Each category page contains subcategory outcomes, methodology guidance, and informative reference mappings.

| Function | Code | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| [Govern](/docs/functions/govern) | GV | Establish and monitor risk management strategy, expectations, and policy |
| [Identify](/docs/functions/identify) | ID | Understand assets, risks, and improvements |
| [Protect](/docs/functions/protect) | PR | Implement safeguards for critical services |
| [Detect](/docs/functions/detect) | DE | Find and analyze anomalies and adverse events |
| [Respond](/docs/functions/respond) | RS | Take action regarding detected incidents |
| [Recover](/docs/functions/recover) | RC | Restore capabilities after an incident |

## Templates

[Templates](/docs/templates) provide empty, fill-in structures for applying the methodology. Two variants:

- **[Template (Org)](/docs/templates/complete)** — all 6 functions, for organisation-wide assessment
- **[Template (Component)](/docs/templates/component)** — ID, PR, DE only, for products and system components

## References

[References](/docs/references) contains informative reference mappings and raw NIST CSF 2.0 data:

- **Informative References** — ISO 27001, CIS Benchmarks, SLSA mapped to NIST subcategories
- **NIST CSF 2.0 data** — exact subcategory definitions and implementation examples

## Examples

[Taskflow](/docs/examples/taskflow) is a worked example showing what a completed assessment looks like for a fictional SaaS product, covering all 6 functions with filled-in tables and full traceability.

## Conventions

[Conventions](/docs/conventions) covers ID schemes, severity levels, and traceability rules.

## Agents

[Agents](/docs/agents) documents the Claude Code skills that maintain and apply Kilpi.
