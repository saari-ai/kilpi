description: History of changes to the Kilpi methodology
---

## 2026-02-26

- Added **Component Register** to the template — the bridge between org governance and per-component assessments. Lists every component with its code, owner, data classification, and criticality.
- **Scope change:** Org scope now owns only GV, RS, RC. Component scope owns ID, PR, DE. Removed overlap where both levels claimed Identify, Protect, and Detect. The org sets policy; components implement controls.
- Deleted org-level ID, PR, DE template pages (13 files). The template now covers Govern, Component Register, Respond, and Recover at the org level, with Identify, Protect, and Detect nested under each registered component.
- Shared infrastructure (shared auth, monitoring platform, CI/CD) is now assessed as its own component, not at the org level.
- Merged `kilpi_org` and `kilpi_component` skills into a single `kilpi` skill that walks through the entire unified template.
