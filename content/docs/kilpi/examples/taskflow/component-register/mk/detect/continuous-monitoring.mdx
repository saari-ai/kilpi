description: Marketing Site example for continuous-monitoring

For methodology guidance, see [DE.CM: Continuous Monitoring](/docs/kilpi/functions/detect/continuous-monitoring).

---

### DE.CM-01: Network monitoring

| What to monitor | Method | Alert threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Site availability | Uptime monitoring service (e.g., Pingdom or UptimeRobot) | **High**: Site returns non-200 for more than 5 minutes. |
| CloudFront error rate | CloudWatch metrics on 4xx/5xx responses | **Medium**: Error rate exceeds 5% over a 15-minute window. |

---

### DE.CM-02: Physical environment monitoring

The marketing site runs entirely on AWS managed infrastructure. Physical environment monitoring is delegated to AWS under the shared responsibility model.

---

### DE.CM-03: Personnel activity monitoring

| What to monitor | Method | Alert threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Contentful CMS access | Contentful audit log | **Medium**: Login from unrecognized user or new IP. |
| S3 bucket policy changes | CloudTrail events for `PutBucketPolicy`, `PutBucketAcl`, `PutPublicAccessBlock` | **High**: S3 BlockPublicAccess setting changed or public ACL added. |
| Route 53 record changes | CloudTrail events for `ChangeResourceRecordSets` | **High**: DNS record modified outside of CI deploy pipeline. |

---

### DE.CM-06: External service provider monitoring

| What to monitor | Method | Alert threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Dependency scanning results | Dependabot / `npm audit` in CI | **High**: Critical or high CVE in a production dependency. **Medium**: Scanning job not run in 7+ days. |

---

### DE.CM-09: Application and runtime monitoring

| What to monitor | Method | Alert threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Content integrity | Periodic hash comparison of deployed site vs expected build output | **High**: Hash mismatch detected (possible unauthorized modification). |
| CloudFront cache hit ratio | CloudWatch metrics | **Medium**: Cache hit ratio drops below 80% (possible cache poisoning or misconfiguration). |

## Alerting tiers

Every alert trigger above maps to one of two tiers. Given the low criticality and public data classification, there is no "Critical (immediate page)" tier for this component.

| Tier | Response time | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **High** (same-day investigation) | Alert to engineering channel. Investigation within 8 hours. | S3 bucket policy change. DNS record change outside CI. Content integrity mismatch. Critical CVE in dependency. Site down for 5+ minutes. |
| **Medium** (weekly review) | Included in weekly review. Triaged within 7 days. | Elevated CloudFront error rate. Unrecognized CMS login. Low cache hit ratio. Scan not running. |
