### ID.AM-01: Hardware inventory

The marketing site runs entirely on AWS managed services (S3, CloudFront). There is no physical hardware managed by the organization. The relevant infrastructure assets are:

| Asset | Type | Location | Owner | Criticality |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <span id="SA-MK-1" style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SA-MK-1</span> Static site | Next.js SSG deployed to S3 | AWS S3 / CloudFront | Frontend team | Low |
| <span id="SA-MK-3" style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SA-MK-3</span> CDN | CloudFront distribution | AWS CloudFront | Frontend team | Low |
| <span id="SA-MK-4" style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SA-MK-4</span> DNS records | Route 53 hosted zone | AWS Route 53 | Frontend team | Low |

### ID.AM-02: Software and services inventory

| Asset | Type | Owner | Data classification | Criticality |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <span id="SA-MK-2" style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SA-MK-2</span> Headless CMS | Contentful (SaaS) | Frontend team | Public | Low |

### ID.AM-03: Network data flows

                                                ┌──────────────┐
                                                │  CloudFront  │───▶ Browsers

                                                └──────────────┘
```

Content is authored in Contentful, pulled at build time by the Next.js static site generator, and deployed as static HTML/CSS/JS to an S3 bucket. CloudFront serves the content to browsers over HTTPS. There is no server-side runtime, no database, and no user authentication.

### ID.AM-04: Supplier services

| Supplier | Service | Data processed | Authorized by | Trust level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Contentful | Headless CMS | Public marketing content | Frontend lead | Medium (SOC 2 compliant) |
| AWS | Infrastructure (S3, CloudFront, Route 53) | Static files, DNS | Frontend lead | High (SOC 2, ISO 27001) |

---

### ID.AM-05: Asset prioritization

| Classification | Definition |
|---|---|
| Public | All content on the marketing site is intended for public access |

| Criticality | Definition |
|---|---|
| Low | Site outage causes reputational inconvenience but no operational impact. No sensitive data at risk. |

---

### ID.AM-07: Data inventory

| Data type | Classification | Owner | Storage location | Retention |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <span id="SA-MK-5" style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SA-MK-5</span> CMS API keys | Restricted | Frontend team | CI environment variables | Rotated semi-annually |
| <span id="SA-MK-6" style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SA-MK-6</span> Published content | Public | Frontend team | Contentful (source) + S3 (deployed) | Indefinite |

The content delivery API key is read-only and poses minimal risk if exposed. The management API key can modify content and must be protected.

### ID.AM-08: Lifecycle management

| Asset | Lifecycle stage | Last reviewed | Next action | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Next.js (latest LTS) | Active | Q4 2025 | Upgrade when new LTS available | Frontend team |
| Contentful integration | Active | Q4 2025 | No action needed | Frontend team |
| npm dependencies | Active | Monthly | Continuous Dependabot monitoring | Frontend team |
