### GV.OV-01: Review strategy outcomes

| Frequency | What is reviewed | Participants |
|---|---|---|
| Per feature/integration | Run through Identify classification. Does it introduce new assets, trust boundaries, or threat surface? Add threats to register, define controls, add monitoring. Update risk tolerance table if a new threat area is introduced. | Security lead, feature developer |
| Monthly (dependency audit) | Dependabot alerts. Known CVEs in direct and transitive dependencies. Patch critical and high CVEs within 48 hours. Medium within 2 weeks. Document any accepted risk for CVEs that cannot be patched immediately. | Dependency maintainer, security lead |
| Quarterly | Full threat register (<span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>ST-TF-1</span> through <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>ST-TF-20</span>). Control inventory (<span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SC-TF-1.1</span> through <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>SC-TF-8.1</span>). Accepted risks. Dependency audit results. Close resolved threats. Adjust severity if likelihood has changed. Add new controls if gaps found. Update roles table if team structure changed. | Security lead, CTO, all developers |
| Annually | Entire security posture end-to-end. Risk tolerance levels. Compliance requirements (GDPR, PCI). Team roles and ownership. Full refresh of the Govern document. Re-validate that tolerance levels still match business context. Confirm all roles are staffed and current. | Security lead, CTO, legal |

### GV.OV-02: Review and adjust strategy

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| Post-incident | Review incident root cause. Determine whether existing controls caught or missed the issue. Evaluate detection and response timelines. Add new threats if the incident revealed an unmodelled attack path. Strengthen or add controls. Update detection rules. Revise playbooks based on lessons learned. |
| Regulatory change | Assess impact on compliance posture. Update affected policies and controls. Brief engineering team on new requirements. |
| Major infrastructure change | Re-evaluate trust boundaries and dependency map. Run through Identify for any new assets or data flows. |
| Customer or audit finding | Triage finding against existing threat register. If new, add to register and schedule control implementation. If known, validate existing controls are effective. |

### GV.OV-03: Performance evaluation

| Metric | What it tells you |
|---|---|
| Mean time to patch critical CVE | Whether the 48-hour SLA is being met. Trend shows if dependency hygiene is improving or degrading. |
| Open critical/high threats without controls | Number of unaddressed high-severity risks. Should trend toward zero. |
| Incident response time (detection to containment) | Whether the response playbooks are effective. Target: Critical contained within 15 minutes. |
| Audit log coverage | Percentage of admin actions with corresponding audit log entries. Target: 100%. |
| Secret scan findings per quarter | Whether secret management policy is being followed. Target: zero findings in production logs and code. |
| Control verification pass rate | Percentage of controls that pass their evidence checks at quarterly review. Target: 100%. |
