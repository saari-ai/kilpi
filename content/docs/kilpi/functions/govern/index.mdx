description: Establish strategy, expectations, and policy that inform all other security functions.

Govern wraps all five operational functions. It establishes the risk tolerance, roles, policies, and oversight cadence that every other function depends on. Without Govern, the rest of the framework has no anchor — controls exist without context, incidents get handled without process, and reviews don't happen.

For a small team, this doesn't mean bureaucracy. It means decisions are written down, roles are clear, and the program gets reviewed as the system grows.

## Recommended sequence

All six Govern categories are required. Work through them in dependency order — each builds on what comes before it.

<Steps>
<Step>
### GV.OC — Organisational Context
Comes first because everything else references your mission, stakeholders, and obligations.
</Step>
<Step>
### GV.RM — Risk Management Strategy
Needs organisational context to set meaningful risk appetite and severity thresholds.
</Step>
<Step>
### GV.RR — Roles & Responsibilities
Can only be assigned once you know what risks you are managing and for whom.
</Step>
<Step>
### GV.PO — Policy
Codifies the decisions from the previous three categories into enforceable expectations.
</Step>
<Step>
### GV.OV — Oversight
Defines how you review and adjust — which requires policies and roles to already exist.
</Step>
<Step>
### GV.SC — Supply Chain Risk Management
Applies your risk strategy and policies to third parties and dependencies.
</Step>
</Steps>

For small teams, later categories can start light. A three-row supplier table is enough to begin GV.SC — but it must exist.

|----------|-----|-------------|
| [Organizational Context](./organizational-context) | GV.OC | Mission, stakeholders, legal/regulatory requirements |
| [Risk Management Strategy](./risk-management-strategy) | GV.RM | Risk tolerance, priorities, severity-action mapping |
| [Roles & Responsibilities](./roles-responsibilities) | GV.RR | Who owns what in the security program |
| [Policy](./policy) | GV.PO | Security policies as enforceable expectations |

## When is Govern complete?

Govern is complete when:

1. The organisation's mission and stakeholder expectations are documented (GV.OC)
2. Risk appetite, tolerance thresholds, and severity matrix are defined (GV.RM)
3. Security roles and responsibilities are assigned to named individuals (GV.RR)
4. Security policies are documented and enforceable (GV.PO)
5. A review cadence is established with defined triggers (GV.OV)
6. Critical suppliers and dependencies are inventoried with risk assessments (GV.SC)
