## Our methodology

On a small team, security roles are not full-time positions — they are responsibilities that specific people own alongside their other work. The point is to make sure that when something needs a security decision, everyone knows who makes it.

---

### GV.RR-01: Leadership accountability

Ensure organizational leadership is accountable for cybersecurity risk and fosters a risk-aware culture. Leadership does not need to do security work — they need to own the outcomes and set the expectation that security matters.

---

### GV.RR-02: Roles and responsibilities

Define who owns each area of security work. For small teams, one person may hold multiple roles. What matters is that it is explicit.

| Role | Responsibility | Authority |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| *e.g. Security lead* | *Owns strategy, maintains threat register, drives assessments* | *Can block releases for unresolved Critical findings* |
| *e.g. Product owner* | *Defines risk appetite per product, approves risk acceptance* | *Signs off on accepted risks above Low severity* |
| *e.g. Engineering lead* | *Implements controls, ensures secure development practices* | *Owns technical remediation decisions* |
| *e.g. All engineers* | *Follow secure coding practices, report potential vulnerabilities* | *Raise issues without approval gates* |
| | | |

### GV.RR-03: Resource allocation

Allocate time and budget for security work proportional to the risk profile. Without explicit allocation, security consistently loses to feature work.

| Resource type | Allocation | Rationale |
|--------------|------------|-----------|
| *e.g. Sprint capacity* | *10-15% reserved for security work* | *Control implementation, dependency updates, assessments* |
| *e.g. Escalation budget* | *Critical/High findings override normal priority* | *Unresolved findings increase exposure every day they wait* |
| *e.g. Training* | *Quarterly security training per engineer* | *Keep current on practices relevant to the stack* |
| | | |

### GV.RR-04: Human resources practices

Integrate security into hiring, onboarding, role changes, and offboarding. Access should follow the principle of least privilege from day one and be revoked promptly on departure.

| HR event | Security action |
|----------|----------------|
| *Onboarding* | *Receive security policy, grant minimum required access* |
| *Role change* | *Review and adjust access to match new responsibilities* |
| *Offboarding* | *Revoke access, rotate shared credentials if applicable* |
| *Screening* | *Background check for roles with elevated access* |
