description: Understand what you have and what could go wrong.

Identify answers the question: **what do we have, and what could go wrong?**

Before selecting controls or building anything, classify what a change touches — what data, what trust boundaries, what assets, what attack surface. Every change runs through Identify first. The outputs (asset register, data flow diagram, threat model) are the primary inputs for [Protect](../protect).

The function covers three categories. Use the [Component Register](/docs/kilpi/templates/component-register) section of the template to apply them to a specific system.

## Categories

| Category | ID | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| [Asset Management](./asset-management) | ID.AM | Inventories, scope, data classification |
| [Risk Assessment](./risk-assessment) | ID.RA | Threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, impact |
| [Improvement](./improvement) | ID.IM | Feedback loops from all functions back into improvements |

## When is Identify complete?

Identify is complete when:

1. All assets are registered with IDs (`SA-{component}-*`) and classified by criticality and data sensitivity (ID.AM)
2. Data flows are documented, with trust boundaries marked (ID.AM-03)
3. STRIDE has been applied to every data flow crossing a trust boundary (ID.RA-03)
4. All identified threats are scored using the severity matrix (ID.RA-04)
5. Risk responses (mitigate, accept, transfer, avoid) are chosen for every Medium severity and above finding (ID.RA-06)
