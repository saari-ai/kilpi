description: The six NIST CSF 2.0 functions that organize our security methodology
---

CSF organizes cybersecurity outcomes into six functions. Govern sits at the centre, establishing risk management strategy and policy. The remaining five form a lifecycle: know what you have, protect it, watch for attacks, respond to incidents, recover.
