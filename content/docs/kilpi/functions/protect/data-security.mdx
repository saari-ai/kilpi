## Our methodology

Data security controls follow directly from the data classification done during [Identify](/docs/kilpi/functions/identify). Every data store, data flow, and data processing step identified in the threat model needs protection commensurate with the classification of the data it handles.

---

### PR.DS-01: Data at rest

Document how each data store is encrypted, what key management approach is used, and who controls the keys.

| Data store | Encryption method | Key management | Key rotation |
|---|---|---|---|
| *e.g. Primary database (MongoDB Atlas)* | *AES-256, transparent encryption at rest* | *Provider-managed (AWS KMS)* | *Annual, automatic* |
| *e.g. Object storage (S3)* | *SSE-S3* | *Provider-managed* | *Automatic* |
| *e.g. Developer workstations* | *Full disk encryption (FileVault / BitLocker)* | *User-managed* | *N/A* |
| *e.g. Backups* | *Same as source (AES-256)* | *Same as source* | *Same as source* |
| | | | |

---

### PR.DS-02: Data in transit

Document the encryption standard for each communication path. All network traffic carrying sensitive data must be encrypted.

| Communication path | Protocol | Minimum version | Additional controls |
|---|---|---|---|
| *e.g. User to API* | *TLS* | *1.2* | *HSTS, no fallback to HTTP* |
| *e.g. Service to service* | *mTLS* | *1.2* | *Certificate pinning* |
| *e.g. App to database* | *TLS* | *1.2* | *Certificate verification enabled* |
| | | | |

Do not reuse production data in non-production environments. Use anonymized or synthetic data sets for testing.

---

### PR.DS-10: Data in use

Protect sensitive data while it is being processed in memory. This is harder than at-rest or in-transit protection — focus on minimizing exposure.

| Control | What it covers | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| *e.g. Memory management* | *Credentials, tokens, PII* | *Clear from memory immediately after use* |
| *e.g. Process isolation* | *Multi-tenant data separation* | *Tenant-scoped queries, no shared memory between tenants* |
| *e.g. Log sanitization* | *Credentials, API keys, PII* | *Built into application logging — redact before writing, not after* |
| *e.g. Secrets in environment* | *Environment variables* | *Injected at runtime, not baked into images or committed to source* |
| | | |

---

### PR.DS-11: Backups

Define the backup schedule, storage location, encryption, and restore testing cadence for each critical data source.

| Data source | Backup frequency | Storage location | Encryption | Restore test cadence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *e.g. Primary database* | *Continuous (point-in-time recovery)* | *Different region, same provider* | *AES-256 (same as source)* | *Quarterly* |
| *e.g. Object storage* | *Cross-region replication* | *Different region* | *SSE-S3* | *Annually* |
| *e.g. Configuration / secrets* | *On change* | *Separate account* | *Encrypted at rest* | *Annually* |
