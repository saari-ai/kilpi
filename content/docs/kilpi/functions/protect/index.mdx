Protect turns threats into controls. The primary input is the scored threat register from [Identify](../identify) — every threat gets a control, every control gets evidence, and the trace is documented end-to-end.

## From threats to controls

The process follows these steps:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Gather threats
Read the scored threats from Identify. Severity determines priority.
</Step>
<Step>
### Select controls per threat
For each threat, write a testable control statement. The threat describes the attack mechanism; the control is what prevents it. Use [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) and [CIS Benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks) as control pattern sources — they provide concrete, well-tested controls for common web application and infrastructure threats.
</Step>
<Step>
### Map to subcategories
Assign each control to the appropriate PR category below. This confirms coverage and catches gaps.
</Step>
<Step>
### Prioritize by severity
Critical and High threats drive the controls that block shipping. Medium and Low are tracked with target dates.
</Step>
<Step>
### Verify coverage
For each PR subcategory, verify at least one control is mapped. Then check by data classification level:

- **Restricted** data: encryption at rest and in transit, access logging, key management controls must all be present.
- **Confidential** data: encryption at rest and in transit, access controls must be present.
- **Internal** data: access controls must be present.
- **Public** data: integrity controls (tamper protection) should be present.

If the component handles sensitive data but no control addresses encryption, something was missed.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Categories

| Category | ID | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| [Identity Management & Access Control](./identity-management-access-control) | PR.AA | Authentication, authorization, credential lifecycle |
| [Awareness & Training](./awareness-training) | PR.AT | Security awareness and secure coding patterns |
| [Data Security](./data-security) | PR.DS | Encryption, secrets, data retention |
| [Platform Security](./platform-security) | PR.PS | Security headers, TLS, hardened configuration |
| [Infrastructure Resilience](./infrastructure-resilience) | PR.IR | Rate limiting, input validation, backups |

Use the [Component Register](/docs/kilpi/templates/component-register) section of the template to apply Protect controls to a specific system.

## When is Protect complete?

Protect is complete when:

1. Every threat rated Medium or above in the threat register has at least one control mapped to it
2. Every control has a unique ID (`SC-{component}-*`), a testable statement, and a mapped NIST subcategory
3. Coverage checks pass for every data classification level present in the asset register
4. Critical and High severity threats have controls with evidence of implementation (not just planned)
