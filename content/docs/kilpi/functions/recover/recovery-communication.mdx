## Our methodology

Recovery communication is distinct from incident response reporting ([RS.CO](../respond/incident-response-reporting)). Response reporting is about notifying stakeholders that an incident occurred. Recovery communication is about keeping stakeholders informed as services are restored — what is working again, what is still down, and when to expect full restoration.

### RC.CO-03: Internal and stakeholder recovery updates

Provide regular, structured updates to internal and external stakeholders during recovery. Ad-hoc messages create confusion. Keep updates factual — "Database restored, running integrity checks, expecting application available by 14:00 UTC" is useful. "Making good progress" is not.

**Internal update cadence:**

| Severity | Update frequency | Who receives |
|---|---|---|
| *Critical* | *Every 2-4 hours until major services restored, then daily* | *All leadership, engineering, affected teams* |
| *High* | *Daily until resolved* | *Engineering leadership, affected teams* |
| *Medium* | *At key milestones (containment, partial restore, full restore)* | *Incident log, team lead* |
| *Low* | *At resolution* | *Incident log* |
| | | |

**External stakeholder notifications:**

| Stakeholder | What to communicate | Channel |
|---|---|---|
| *Affected customers* | *Restoration progress, actions they need to take, timelines* | *Same channel as initial breach notification* |
| *Regulators* | *Follow-up reports, updated scope if broader than initially reported* | *Per regulatory framework* |
| *Partners/suppliers* | *When shared services restored, joint recovery coordination* | *Pre-established protocols* |

### RC.CO-04: Public updates

For incidents affecting public-facing services or involving personal data, use approved channels only — status page, official blog, or designated spokesperson. Explain what happened in plain language, describe concrete steps being taken, and provide timelines where possible.

| Update stage | Channel | Content | Approval |
|---|---|---|---|
| *During recovery* | *Status page* | *Current status, affected services, next update time* | *Incident lead* |
| *At full recovery* | *Blog / status page* | *Summary: what happened, what was affected, what changed to prevent recurrence* | *Incident lead + leadership* |
