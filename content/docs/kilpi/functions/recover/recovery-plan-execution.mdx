## Our methodology

Recovery follows a specific sequence: restore from a known-good state, verify controls are back in place, confirm normal operations, then run a post-mortem. Rushing through this sequence — especially skipping verification — risks putting a still-compromised system back into production.

---

### RC.RP-01: Recovery initiation

Activate the recovery plan once [Incident Management](../respond/incident-management) confirms the criteria are met (RS.MA-05). Brief all participants on the plan, their responsibilities, and required authorizations before beginning.

| Pre-recovery check | Status |
|---|---|
| *Containment and eradication confirmed complete* | *Yes / No* |
| *Recovery participants briefed on plan and responsibilities* | *Yes / No* |
| *Systems requiring recovery identified and ordered* | *Yes / No* |
| | |

---

### RC.RP-02: Recovery prioritization

Not everything comes back at the same time. Select and prioritize recovery actions based on business impact. The incident lead can reprioritize as the situation evolves.

| Priority | Category | Systems | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|
| *1* | *Critical services* | *Customer-facing APIs, primary database* | *Business cannot function without these* |
| *2* | *Dependencies* | *Auth service, shared infrastructure* | *Downstream systems depend on these* |
| *3* | *Supporting services* | *Internal tools, monitoring* | *Business can function briefly without these* |
| *4* | *Everything else* | *Remaining systems* | *Restore after critical services confirmed* |
| | | | |

### RC.RP-03: Backup verification

Before restoring from any backup or image, verify it is clean and intact. If the attacker had access for weeks before detection, recent backups may also be compromised. Work backward from the timeline in [Incident Analysis](../respond/incident-analysis) to find the most recent safe restore point.

| Backup | IOC scan result | Integrity check | Safe restore point |
|---|---|---|---|
| *e.g. DB backup 2024-01-14* | *Clean* | *Hashes match, consistency verified* | *Yes — predates compromise* |
| *e.g. DB backup 2024-01-15* | *Indicators found* | *N/A* | *No — post-compromise* |
| | | | |

### RC.RP-04: Post-incident operational norms

After restoration, the operating environment may need to differ from before the incident. Apply temporary restrictions, update baselines, and get system owner sign-off before declaring a system fully restored.

| Adjustment | Details | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| *Temporary access restrictions* | *Tighter access controls until confidence restored* | *Until post-mortem action items complete* |
| *Increased monitoring* | *Higher sensitivity on recovered systems* | *Minimum 2 weeks post-restoration* |
| *Updated baselines* | *Revised config baselines, access policies, alert thresholds* | *Permanent* |
| *System owner sign-off* | *Owner confirms system is working and security posture is acceptable* | *Before production use* |
| | | |

#### Feedback loop

Every incident reveals something about the system's real threat landscape. Before declaring recovery complete, document what changes across the framework. This is the structured version of the feedback loop described in the [Recover index](./index.mdx#feedback-loop).

| Recovery type | Identify update | Protect update | Detect update |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| *e.g. Credential compromise* | *Add credential theft to threat register, update likelihood to High* | *Add forced rotation control, shorten token lifetimes* | *Add monitoring for bulk credential usage, impossible travel* |
| *e.g. Data exposure* | *Reclassify affected data if scope changed* | *Tighten access controls, add field-level encryption* | *Add monitoring for unusual data access patterns* |
| *e.g. Application exploit* | *Add exploit vector to threat register* | *Add input validation, WAF rule, or patch* | *Add monitoring for exploit signatures, anomalous request patterns* |
| | | | |

See the [Taskflow RC.RP-04](/docs/kilpi/examples/taskflow/recover/recovery-plan-execution) example for a fully populated version.

### RC.RP-05: Restoration verification

For each restored system, verify controls are operational, test functionality, and monitor closely before returning to production. Do not restore the vulnerability along with the service.

| Verification step | Check | Result |
|---|---|---|
| *Restore from verified backup* | *Backup applied, patches from eradication included* | *Pass / Fail* |
| *Security controls operational* | *Auth, authz, encryption, logging, monitoring confirmed* | *Pass / Fail* |
| *Functionality test* | *Smoke tests pass, data integrity verified, integrations working* | *Pass / Fail* |
| *IOC re-scan* | *No indicators of compromise on restored system* | *Clean / Not clean* |
| | | |

### RC.RP-06: After-action report and closure

Prepare an after-action report documenting the incident, response actions, and lessons learned. Declare recovery complete only when all criteria are met. The incident lead formally closes the incident.

| Report section | Content |
|---|---|
| *What happened* | *Timeline from initial compromise through detection, response, and recovery* |
| *What worked* | *Controls, detection rules, and procedures that performed as intended* |
| *What failed* | *Missing or bypassed controls, slow detection, process breakdowns* |
| *Root cause* | *Systemic reason the incident was possible — process or organizational gap* |
| *Action items* | *Mapped to framework: [Identify](../identify), [Protect](../protect), [Detect](../detect), [Respond](../respond)* |

**Closure criteria:**

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| *All affected systems restored and verified* | *Yes / No* |
| *All security controls confirmed operational* | *Yes / No* |
| *Monitoring shows normal behaviour for observation period* | *Yes / No* |
| *Root cause addressed or compensating controls tracked* | *Yes / No* |
| *After-action report completed and action items assigned* | *Yes / No* |
| | |
