Kilpi is a standalone security methodology built on NIST CSF 2.0, that can be adopted by any organisation, startup or solopreneur. It provides the structure, conventions, and operational guidance needed to run a traceable, outcome-driven security program.

The structure and documentation are designed to be directly consumable by AI agents, so they can apply the methodology autonomously. At the same time, it's written to be easy for humans to follow along &mdash; whether to understand what an agent is doing, or to apply the methodology themselves.

Kilpi defines a systematic, repeatable approach with defined procedures, artifacts, and principles for achieving security outcomes.


<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion value="procedures" title={<span className="flex items-center gap-2"><ShieldCheck className="text-green-500" size={18} /> Defined Procedures & Processes</span>}>
    Kilpi prescribes step-by-step work at every level: asset inventory, threat modeling (STRIDE), risk scoring (likelihood x impact), control selection, monitoring rule definition, response playbooks, recovery plans, and feedback loops. Each step has concrete instructions, not just suggestions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion value="artifacts" title={<span className="flex items-center gap-2"><ShieldCheck className="text-green-500" size={18} /> Concrete, Named Artifacts with an ID Scheme</span>}>
    It produces traceable deliverables with strict naming conventions (SA-*, ST-*, SC-*). A framework tells you "identify assets." A methodology tells you to produce an Asset Register with columns for ID, name, type, owner, criticality, and classification — and gives you the template.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion value="traceability" title={<span className="flex items-center gap-2"><ShieldCheck className="text-green-500" size={18} /> End-to-End Traceability Chain</span>}>
    Nothing exists in isolation. Every artifact traces through a chain: Asset → Threat → Control → Monitoring Rule → Response Playbook → Recovery Plan. Every artifact references back to its predecessors, creating full accountability.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion value="principles" title={<span className="flex items-center gap-2"><ShieldCheck className="text-green-500" size={18} /> Guiding Principles & Philosophy</span>}>
    "The pipeline IS the policy" (automation-first). Risk-driven prioritisation via severity matrix. Continuous improvement feedback loops (ID.IM). Controls are not just documented — they are enforced through automated checks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion value="repeatable" title={<span className="flex items-center gap-2"><ShieldCheck className="text-green-500" size={18} /> Scoped, Repeatable Application</span>}>
    A single template defines who does what at which level, preventing duplication. The methodology can be applied consistently across any organisation and any component.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion value="example" title={<span className="flex items-center gap-2"><ShieldCheck className="text-green-500" size={18} /> Worked Example Demonstrating Application</span>}>
    The Taskflow example shows the methodology applied end-to-end to a realistic system — 20 threats, 12 assets, full control inventory, monitoring rules, response playbooks. This demonstrates that the methodology produces concrete, verifiable results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion value="foundation" title={<span className="flex items-center gap-2"><ShieldCheck className="text-green-500" size={18} /> Built on Established Foundation (NIST CSF 2.0)</span>}>
    Kilpi doesn't invent its own taxonomy. It provides the **how** on top of NIST's **what**, covering all 106 subcategories with actionable guidance. This ensures alignment with the most widely adopted cybersecurity framework.

## Foundation

Kilpi uses the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 as its organizing structure. CSF defines **what** outcomes to achieve. Kilpi defines **how** we achieve them. The framework organizes outcomes into three tiers:

```
Function (6)
  └─ Category (22 total)
      └─ Subcategory (106 total)
```

<Image src={kilpiGovernDiagram} alt="Kilpi — Govern wraps Identify, Protect, Recover, and Respond" style={{maxWidth: '280px', height: 'auto'}} />

Govern sits at the centre. The remaining five functions form a lifecycle: know what you have (Identify), protect it (Protect), watch for attacks (Detect), act on incidents (Respond), get back to normal (Recover).

## Scope

Kilpi operates at two levels. See [Scope](/docs/kilpi/scope) for detail.

| Level | Functions covered | Template section |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Organisation | GV, RS, RC | [Govern](/docs/kilpi/templates/govern), [Respond](/docs/kilpi/templates/respond), [Recover](/docs/kilpi/templates/recover) |
| Component | ID, PR, DE (inherits GV, RS, RC from org) | [Component Register](/docs/kilpi/templates/component-register) (nested per component) |

## Profiles

NIST CSF uses Profiles to describe an organisation's security posture at a point in time. A completed Kilpi template is your **Current Profile** — it documents which subcategory outcomes you achieve today.

If you need to prioritise, create a **Target Profile** by marking each subcategory as in-scope or out-of-scope based on your risk appetite and business objectives. This can be as simple as a table listing each subcategory with In Scope (Y/N) and Target State columns. The gap between Current and Target drives investment decisions.

## Techniques

Kilpi uses established techniques at specific points in the methodology:

| Technique | Used in | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **STRIDE** | Identify (ID.RA) | Threat identification — six categories that systematically cover how systems get attacked: **S**poofing (impersonating a user or system), **T**ampering (modifying data), **R**epudiation (denying an action), **I**nformation Disclosure (leaking data), **D**enial of Service (making systems unavailable), **E**levation of Privilege (gaining unauthorized access). Applied at trust boundaries. |
| **[MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)** | Identify (ID.RA) | Attack validation — a public knowledge base of real-world adversary tactics and techniques maintained by MITRE Corporation. Used to validate that identified threats are grounded in observed attacker behaviour, not just theoretical risk. Use the Enterprise matrix for SaaS products. |
| **Likelihood x Impact** | Identify (ID.RA) | Risk scoring — combine likelihood and impact into a severity rating that drives priority |

## Traceability

Every security artifact traces through a chain across functions:

```
Asset (ID.AM)
  → Threat (ID.RA)
    → Control (PR.*)
      → Monitoring (DE.*)
        → Response (RS.*)
          → Recovery (RC.*)
```

ID schemes keep artifacts traceable. See [Conventions](/docs/kilpi/conventions) for the full scheme.

| Prefix | Artifact | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| SA- | Asset | SA-TF-1 |
| ST- | Threat | ST-TF-1 |
| SC- | Control | SC-TF-1 |

## Functions

The methodology pages live under [Functions](/docs/kilpi/functions). Each category page contains subcategory outcomes, methodology guidance, and informative reference mappings.

| Function | Code | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| [Govern](/docs/kilpi/functions/govern) | GV | Establish and monitor risk management strategy, expectations, and policy |
| [Identify](/docs/kilpi/functions/identify) | ID | Understand assets, risks, and improvements |
| [Protect](/docs/kilpi/functions/protect) | PR | Implement safeguards for critical services |
| [Detect](/docs/kilpi/functions/detect) | DE | Find and analyze anomalies and adverse events |
| [Respond](/docs/kilpi/functions/respond) | RS | Take action regarding detected incidents |
| [Recover](/docs/kilpi/functions/recover) | RC | Restore capabilities after an incident |

## Templates

The [Template](/docs/kilpi/templates) provides the fill-in structure for applying the methodology. It covers all six functions — Govern, Respond, and Recover at the org level, and Identify, Protect, and Detect per component via the Component Register.

## References

[References](/docs/kilpi/references) contains informative reference mappings and raw NIST CSF 2.0 data:

- **Informative References** — ISO 27001, CIS Benchmarks, SLSA mapped to NIST subcategories
- **NIST CSF 2.0 data** — exact subcategory definitions and implementation examples

## Examples
