SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artefacts) is a framework for ensuring the integrity of software artefacts throughout the supply chain. It defines a series of levels, each with increasingly strict requirements for how software is built and distributed.

Traditional security frameworks underweight supply chain threats. ISO 27001 addresses supplier relationships (A.5.19-5.22) and secure development (A.8.25-8.31), but SLSA provides a more granular, build-focused model that fills the gap.

## How it fits

SLSA primarily maps to CSF subcategories under **Govern > Supply Chain Risk Management** (<span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>GV.SC</span>) and **Protect > Platform Security** (<span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>PR.PS</span>). It answers a specific question: can you prove that the artefact you deployed is the artefact your source code intended?

## SLSA levels and CSF mapping

| Level | Requirements | What it proves | CSF subcategories |
|---|---|---|---|
| SLSA 1 | Build process is documented | You know how artefacts are built. The build process is not opaque. | <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>GV.SC-05</span>, <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>PR.PS-06</span> |
| SLSA 2 | Build service is hosted and generates provenance | Builds are not run on developer machines. Provenance is machine-generated, not self-attested. | <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>GV.SC-05</span>, <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>GV.SC-07</span>, <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>PR.PS-06</span> |
| SLSA 3 | Source and build platforms meet audit requirements | Builds are isolated. Source is version-controlled. Provenance is non-falsifiable. | <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>GV.SC-05</span>, <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>GV.SC-07</span>, <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>PR.PS-01</span>, <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>PR.PS-06</span> |
| SLSA 4 | Two-person review, hermetic builds, reproducible | No single individual can push a compromised artefact. Builds are fully reproducible and hermetically sealed. | <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>GV.SC-05</span>, <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>GV.SC-07</span>, <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>GV.SC-09</span>, <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>PR.PS-01</span>, <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>PR.PS-06</span> |

## Build integrity requirements

Each SLSA level builds on the previous one. The key requirements at each level are:

### SLSA 1 — Documented build

- Build process exists and is documented
- Artefacts have some form of provenance (even if manually created)
- Prevents: complete lack of visibility into how software is built

### SLSA 2 — Hosted build with provenance

- Builds run on a hosted service (not developer laptops)
- Provenance is generated automatically by the build service
- Provenance includes source repository, build command, and dependencies
- Prevents: builds that cannot be traced back to their source

### SLSA 3 — Auditable build platform

- Source is version-controlled with authenticated contributors
- Build platform is hardened and auditable
- Provenance is signed and cannot be forged by the build user
- Build environment is isolated (no network access, no shared state between builds)
- Prevents: tampering with the build process itself

### SLSA 4 — Reproducible and reviewed

- All changes require two-person review before merge
- Builds are hermetic — fully isolated with no external dependencies fetched at build time
- Builds are reproducible — same inputs produce identical outputs
- Prevents: a single compromised individual from injecting malicious code

## Annex A cross-reference

SLSA requirements reinforce several ISO 27001 Annex A controls:

| SLSA requirement | Annex A controls |
|---|---|
| Documented build process | <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>A.8.25</span> (Secure development lifecycle) |
| Hosted build service | <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>A.8.31</span> (Separation of environments) |
| Machine-generated provenance | <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>A.8.25</span>, <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>A.8.26</span> (Application security requirements) |
| Two-person review | <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>A.8.28</span> (Secure coding) |
| Hermetic builds | <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>A.8.31</span> (Separation of environments) |
| Supplier provenance verification | <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>A.5.19</span>-<span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>A.5.22</span> (Supplier relationships) |
