For methodology guidance, see [DE.CM: Continuous Monitoring](/docs/kilpi/functions/detect/continuous-monitoring).

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Every High and Critical severity control has at least one monitoring rule defined (DE.CM)
- [ ] Incident declaration criteria defined — conditions that promote an anomaly to an incident (DE.AE)
- [ ] Alert routing configured so each severity level reaches the right responder within the escalation SLA (DE.AE)
