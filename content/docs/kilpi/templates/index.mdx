description: Fill-in template for applying the Kilpi methodology
---

This is the master template for applying the Kilpi methodology. It covers all six NIST CSF 2.0 functions across both organisational and component scopes. Copy this structure when starting an assessment — do not edit the template directly.

The template is organised into four sections. Govern, Respond, and Recover are completed once at the organisational level. The Component Register bridges org and component scope — it lists every component, and each registered component gets its own Identify, Protect, and Detect assessment nested underneath.

| Section | Scope | Categories |
|---------|-------|------------|
| [Govern](/docs/kilpi/templates/govern) | Organisation | Organizational context, risk strategy, roles, policy, oversight, and supply chain risk |
| [Component Register](/docs/kilpi/templates/component-register) | Bridge | Inventory of components, each with nested ID, PR, DE assessments |
| [Respond](/docs/kilpi/templates/respond) | Organisation | Incident management, analysis, reporting, and mitigation |
| [Recover](/docs/kilpi/templates/recover) | Organisation | Recovery plan execution and recovery communication |

For guidance on what to put in each section, see the corresponding function page under [Functions](/docs/kilpi/functions). Start with [Scope](/docs/kilpi/scope) to understand how functions are divided between org and component levels.
