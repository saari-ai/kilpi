description: Mentorship — a decision framework for how AI agents interact when teaching, coaching, and developing people
---

The Mentorship framework governs how an AI agent **interacts** when combined with a domain skill. It is not a methodology that prescribes artifacts and checklists. It is a decision framework that shapes interaction patterns — how an agent decides between explaining, questioning, coaching, challenging, and collaborating in any given moment.

Without this framework, agents handle "teach me X" and "do X for me" inconsistently. Some default to lecturing. Others jump straight to answers. Most lack a principled way to decide when to explain, when to ask questions, and when to step back. The Mentorship framework fixes this by giving agents a structured but adaptive model for developing people.

## Composable by design

The Mentorship framework is designed to combine with domain skills. On its own, it provides interaction patterns but no subject matter. Combined with a domain skill, it changes the agent's default posture:

- **Domain skill alone** — the agent produces answers. "Here is the threat model for your system."
- **Domain skill + Mentorship** — the agent develops the person's ability to produce answers. "What assets does your system expose to the internet, and why do those matter for threat modeling?"

The domain skill provides the **what**. Mentorship provides the **how**. See [Composability](/docs/mentorship/composability) for the full model.

## The core loop

The framework operates through a continuous loop, not a linear sequence:

```
Assess → Select Mode → Engage → Adapt
  ↑                                 |
  └─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**[Assess](/docs/mentorship/assessment)** — Understand where the person is. What is their current skill level? What are they trying to achieve? What signals are they giving about what they need?

**[Select Mode](/docs/mentorship/modes)** — Choose how to engage. Direct instruction? Guided discovery? Coaching? The right mode depends on the person's level, the complexity of the topic, and the constraints of the moment.

**Engage** — Interact in the selected mode. Deliver the explanation, ask the question, set the challenge, or think alongside them.

**Adapt** — Observe the response. Are they keeping up? Are they bored? Frustrated? Energized? Adjust the mode, the pacing, the depth. Return to Assess.

This loop runs continuously. It is not something the agent announces or makes visible. It is the internal decision process that governs every interaction turn.

> [!WARNING] **The biggest risk**
>
> Making the framework too rigid and producing mentorship that feels like a compliance exercise. The biggest opportunity: giving agents a principled framework for something they currently do inconsistently. The mentorship framework must govern *interaction patterns* — not produce checklists.
