## Skills

The Product Discovery skill set comes with a skill for applying the methodology, referencing sections of these docs as its source of truth.

You don't have to use our skill — you can build your own or simply point your agent towards the docs as reference. However, our skill has been tuned to get the best outcomes when applying the methodology.

| Skill | When activated | Reads from |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>product-discovery</span> | Running a discovery process — framing problems, planning research, evaluating evidence, assessing opportunities, and producing a Discovery Brief | All 5 phases ([Problem Framing](/docs/product-discovery/problem-framing), [Customer Research](/docs/product-discovery/customer-research), [Evidence](/docs/product-discovery/evidence), [Opportunity Assessment](/docs/product-discovery/opportunity-assessment), [Synthesis](/docs/product-discovery/synthesis)), [Templates](/docs/product-discovery/templates), [Techniques](/docs/product-discovery/techniques) |

The skill is available at [saari-ai/fiksu-skills](https://github.com/saari-ai/fiksu-skills). Claude users can activate it via the [Saari Claude Marketplace](https://github.com/saari-ai/claude-marketplace).

## State management

The skill persists discovery state via [orch](https://github.com/saari-ai/orch) MCP tools. Every discovery artifact is stored as a work scope, enabling persistence across sessions and visibility into discovery progress.

### Work scope types

The skill uses eight custom work scope definitions, all under the `pd.*` namespace:

| Namespace | Artifact | Status values |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| `pd.discovery` | Discovery (top-level container) | `pending`, `active`, `completed`, `archived` |
| `pd.hypotheses` | Hypotheses container | — |
| `pd.hypothesis` | Hypothesis (PH-\*) | `pending` (Draft), `active`, `supported`, `refuted`, `retired` |
| `pd.evidence` | Evidence item (EV-\*) | `pending` |
| `pd.research-plan` | Research plan | `pending`, `active`, `completed` |
| `pd.insight` | Insight (IN-\*) | `pending` |
| `pd.opportunity` | Opportunity score (OP-\*) | `pending` |
| `pd.brief` | Discovery Brief | `pending`, `draft`, `finalized` |

### Hierarchy

All artifacts are flat children of the discovery. Cross-references between artifacts (e.g. which evidence supports which hypothesis) are tracked through naming conventions and the methodology&rsquo;s traceability chain, not through containment.

```
pd.discovery (e.g. "Solo Agent Orchestration", key: SAO)
  ├ pd.hypotheses      (container)
  │   ├ pd.hypothesis  (SAO-003, SAO-004, ...)
  │   └ ...
  ├ pd.research-plan   (SAO-011)
  ├ pd.evidence        (SAO-013, SAO-014, ...)
  ├ pd.insight         (SAO-020, ...)
  ├ pd.opportunity     (SAO-021, ...)
  └ pd.brief           (SAO-022)
```

### Session resumption

On activation, the skill checks for existing discoveries before starting a new one. It loads the discovery&rsquo;s children to reconstruct current state &mdash; which hypotheses exist, their lifecycle status, evidence gathered so far &mdash; and resumes from where the discovery left off.

### MCP operations

| Action | MCP tool | Key parameters |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Create a discovery | `create_work_scope` | `namespace: "pd.discovery"`, `name`, `keyPrefix`, `parentId` (optional) |
| Create hypotheses container | `create_work_scope` | `namespace: "pd.hypotheses"`, `name: "Hypotheses"`, `parentId` (discovery ID) |
| Create a hypothesis | `create_work_scope` | `namespace: "pd.hypothesis"`, `name`, `parentId` (hypotheses container ID) |
| Create evidence | `create_work_scope` | `namespace: "pd.evidence"`, `name`, `parentId` (discovery ID) |
| Create a research plan | `create_work_scope` | `namespace: "pd.research-plan"`, `name`, `parentId` (discovery ID) |
| Create an insight | `create_work_scope` | `namespace: "pd.insight"`, `name`, `parentId` (discovery ID) |
| Create an opportunity | `create_work_scope` | `namespace: "pd.opportunity"`, `name`, `parentId` (discovery ID) |
| Create the brief | `create_work_scope` | `namespace: "pd.brief"`, `name`, `parentId` (discovery ID) |
| Transition a hypothesis | `update_work_scope` | `id`, `status` (new state) |
| Complete the discovery | `update_work_scope` | `id`, `status: "completed"` |
| List discovery contents | `list_work_scope_children` | `parentId` (discovery ID) |
| Find all discoveries | `list_work_scopes_by_namespace` | `namespace: "pd.discovery"` |
| Delete an artifact | `delete_work_scope` | `id` |

## Workflow

The skill works interactively across the five methodology phases:

1. **Kickoff** &mdash; Asks the human for problem context, constraints, and triggers. Generates a discovery code and creates the `pd.discovery` work scope.
2. **Problem Framing** &mdash; Helps articulate problem statements, generates falsifiable hypotheses, and creates `pd.hypothesis` work scopes for each. Challenges weak hypotheses and prioritises which to test first.
3. **Customer Research Planning** &mdash; Recommends research techniques matched to each hypothesis, generates interview guides, and suggests sample sizes. Creates a `pd.research-plan` work scope with the full plan. The human conducts the research; the agent plans it and processes the results.
4. **Evidence Evaluation** &mdash; Extracts evidence items from research results, weights them on the 1&ndash;5 scale, links them to hypotheses, and creates `pd.evidence` work scopes. Transitions hypothesis statuses as evidence accumulates.
5. **Iteration** &mdash; When evidence contradicts a hypothesis, proposes reframing. New hypotheses get new work scopes; refuted ones are updated.
6. **Opportunity Assessment** &mdash; Generates scored opportunities grounded in evidence and creates `pd.opportunity` work scopes.
7. **Synthesis** &mdash; Extracts insights, drafts the Discovery Brief, and recommends proceed/pivot/kill. Creates `pd.insight` and `pd.brief` work scopes.
