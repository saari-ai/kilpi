- Initial release of the Product Discovery methodology
- Five phases: Problem Framing, Customer Research, Evidence, Opportunity Assessment, Synthesis
- Traceability chain: Hypothesis (PH-) → Evidence (EV-) → Insight (IN-) → Opportunity Score (OP-) → Discovery Brief
- Template set: Discovery Brief, Problem Hypothesis Log, Interview Guide, Evidence Register, Opportunity Scorecard
- Technique catalog with 10 methods: JTBD interviews, contextual inquiry, diary studies, surveys, analytics mining, competitor analysis, expert interviews, concept testing (light), 5 Whys, assumption mapping
- Evidence weight scale (1-5): Anecdotal → Statistically Significant
- Hypothesis lifecycle: Draft → Active → Supported → Refuted → Retired
- Opportunity scoring across 4 dimensions: Market Size, Competitive Intensity, Feasibility, Evidence Strength
- Clear boundary: Discovery finds problems, not solutions. Handoff to Product Validation for solution testing.
