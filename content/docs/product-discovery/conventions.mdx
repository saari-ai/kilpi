description: ID schemes, evidence scales, hypothesis lifecycle, and naming conventions used across the Product Discovery methodology

## ID schemes

We use prefixed ID schemes to uniquely identify discovery artifacts across the documentation. The `{discovery}` segment in each scheme is a short code for the discovery being run (e.g., FN for FocusNote, TM for TeamMetrics). Discovery codes are defined when the discovery starts.

### Hypothesis IDs (PH-)

Problem hypotheses are the starting point. Every hypothesis gets a unique ID.

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `PH-{discovery}-{n}` | PH-FN-1 | First hypothesis for the FocusNote discovery |

### Evidence IDs (EV-)

Evidence items are individual pieces of data gathered during customer research. Every evidence item links back to one or more hypotheses.

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `EV-{discovery}-{n}` | EV-FN-1 | First evidence item for the FocusNote discovery |

### Insight IDs (IN-)

Insights are patterns extracted from multiple evidence items during synthesis. Each insight references the evidence items that support it.

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `IN-{discovery}-{n}` | IN-FN-1 | First insight for the FocusNote discovery |

### Opportunity Score IDs (OP-)

Opportunity scores summarise the attractiveness of an opportunity. Each score references the insights and evidence that inform it.

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `OP-{discovery}-{n}` | OP-FN-1 | First opportunity score for the FocusNote discovery |

## Discovery codes

Discovery codes are short (2-4 character) uppercase identifiers assigned when a discovery begins. They appear in every artifact ID for that discovery.

**Rules:**

- 2-4 uppercase letters
- Derived from the discovery name (e.g., FocusNote → FN, TeamMetrics → TM, SmartBudget → SB)
- Must be unique within the organisation's active discoveries
- Defined in the Problem Hypothesis Log when the discovery is created

**Examples:**

| Discovery name | Code | Usage |
|----------------|------|-------|
| FocusNote | FN | PH-FN-1, EV-FN-3 |
| TeamMetrics | TM | PH-TM-1, EV-TM-2 |
| SmartBudget | SB | PH-SB-1, IN-SB-1 |

## Evidence weight scale

Every evidence item is assigned a weight from 1-5 indicating its strength.

| Weight | Label | Definition | Example |
|--------|-------|------------|---------|
| 1 | Anecdotal | A single data point or offhand comment. No pattern. | One person mentions frustration in passing |
| 2 | Directional | Multiple data points suggesting a trend, but not yet reliable. | 3 of 5 interviewees mention the same problem unprompted |
| 3 | Moderate | Consistent signal across a reasonable sample. Enough to form hypotheses around. | 7 of 10 interviewees describe the same workflow breakdown |
| 4 | Strong | Clear, repeated pattern with supporting quantitative data. High confidence. | Interview pattern confirmed by analytics showing 40% drop-off at the same step |
| 5 | Statistically significant | Large-sample quantitative data with statistical rigour. Highest confidence. | Survey of 500 users with p < 0.05 significance on the core finding |

When assigning weights, be conservative. Most interview evidence lands at weight 2-3. Weight 4-5 requires either large samples or triangulation across multiple methods.

## Hypothesis lifecycle

Every hypothesis moves through a defined lifecycle. The current state is tracked in the [Problem Hypothesis Log](/docs/product-discovery/templates/problem-hypothesis-log).

| State | Meaning | Transitions to |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Draft | Written but not yet actively being tested | Active |
| Active | Currently being tested — evidence is being gathered | Supported, Refuted |
| Supported | Evidence supports the hypothesis at sufficient weight | (terminal, feeds into Insight) |
| Refuted | Evidence contradicts the hypothesis at sufficient weight | Retired, or back to Draft if reframed |
| Retired | No longer relevant — either refuted, superseded, or out of scope | (terminal) |

**Transition rules:**

- A hypothesis moves from Draft to Active when research begins that specifically targets it.
- A hypothesis moves to Supported when it has at least 3 evidence items with an average weight of 3 or higher, and no unresolved contradictory evidence at weight 3+.
- A hypothesis moves to Refuted when contradictory evidence at weight 3+ outweighs supporting evidence, OR a single piece of evidence at weight 5 directly contradicts it.
- A Refuted hypothesis can return to Draft if it is reframed to account for the refuting evidence. The reframed version gets a new PH- ID.
- A hypothesis moves to Retired when the team decides it is no longer worth pursuing, regardless of evidence state.

## Traceability rules

Every artifact must trace back to its predecessors:

| Artifact | Must reference |
|----------|---------------|
| Evidence (EV-) | At least one Hypothesis (PH-) |
| Insight (IN-) | At least two Evidence items (EV-) |
| Opportunity Score (OP-) | At least one Insight (IN-) |
| Discovery Brief | All Supported hypotheses, key Evidence, all Insights, Opportunity Scores |

Orphaned artifacts — evidence not linked to a hypothesis, or insights not grounded in evidence — indicate a gap. Either link them or document why they stand alone.
