title: Evidence
description: Standards, evaluation, and management of evidence throughout discovery

Evidence is the third phase of Product Discovery. While evidence is collected during [Customer Research](/docs/product-discovery/customer-research), this phase focuses on evaluating what you have — is it good enough, strong enough, and unbiased enough to make decisions?

Discovery without evidence standards is just opinion-gathering. Two discovery teams can talk to the same customers and reach opposite conclusions if they do not have shared standards for what counts as evidence and how much is enough.

## The evidence chain

Evidence connects hypotheses to insights through a traceable chain:

```
Hypothesis (PH-)
  → Evidence (EV-)  ← you are here
    → Insight (IN-)
      → Opportunity Score (OP-)
        → Discovery Brief
```

Every evidence item must link back to at least one hypothesis. Evidence that is not linked to a hypothesis is either:
- Missing a hypothesis that should exist (write one), or
- Not relevant to this discovery (exclude it)

## Evidence standards

The methodology defines three dimensions of evidence quality:

| Dimension | Question it answers | Covered in |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| What counts | Is this thing actually evidence? What type is it? What weight does it carry? | [What Counts](/docs/product-discovery/evidence/what-counts) |
| Sufficiency | Do we have enough evidence to make a call on this hypothesis? | [Sufficiency](/docs/product-discovery/evidence/sufficiency) |
| Bias | Are we seeing what is actually there, or what we want to see? | [Bias](/docs/product-discovery/evidence/bias) |

All three dimensions must be satisfied before moving a hypothesis to Supported or Refuted. Strong evidence (high weight) that is insufficient (too few items) or biased (only from one segment) should not drive decisions.

## Evidence register

All evidence items are tracked in the [Evidence Register](/docs/product-discovery/templates/evidence-register). The register is the single source of truth for what evidence exists, how strong it is, and what it connects to.

Review the evidence register regularly during discovery — not just at the end. Look for:

- **Hypotheses with no evidence.** Either start gathering evidence or retire the hypothesis.
- **Evidence clusters.** Multiple items pointing the same direction increase confidence.
- **Contradictions.** Evidence items that support and refute the same hypothesis. Do not ignore these — they usually indicate the hypothesis needs to be refined or split.
- **Weight distribution.** If all your evidence is weight 1-2, you need more research. You cannot build an Opportunity Assessment on anecdotal evidence alone.

## Relationship to other phases

Evidence evaluation is not a one-time gate. As new evidence comes in from [Customer Research](/docs/product-discovery/customer-research), re-evaluate:

- Has a hypothesis crossed the threshold for Supported or Refuted?
- Do emerging patterns warrant new hypotheses back in [Problem Framing](/docs/product-discovery/problem-framing)?
- Is the evidence strong enough to begin [Opportunity Assessment](/docs/product-discovery/opportunity-assessment)?

A common mistake is to rush through evidence evaluation to get to opportunity assessment. Resist this. The quality of your opportunity assessment is bounded by the quality of your evidence.
