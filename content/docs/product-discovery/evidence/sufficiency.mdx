title: Evidence Sufficiency
description: How much evidence is enough to make a call on a hypothesis
---

Sufficiency answers the question: do we have enough evidence to move this hypothesis to Supported or Refuted, or do we need more research?

There is no universal threshold that works for all discoveries. But there are minimum standards that prevent premature decisions and guidelines that prevent over-researching.

## Minimum evidence thresholds

These are the minimum requirements before a hypothesis can move to Supported or Refuted. Meeting the minimum does not automatically change the state — it means you have enough to make a judgment call.

### For moving to Supported

| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Total evidence items | At least 3 items linked to this hypothesis |
| Average weight | Average weight of supporting evidence is 3.0 or higher |
| Source diversity | Evidence from at least 2 different source types (e.g., interviews + analytics) |
| Contradictory evidence | No unresolved contradictory evidence at weight 3 or higher |

If contradictory evidence exists at weight 3+, the hypothesis cannot move to Supported until the contradiction is resolved — either by gathering more evidence, refining the hypothesis, or splitting it.

### For moving to Refuted

| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Direct refutation | A single evidence item at weight 5 directly contradicts the hypothesis, OR |
| Accumulated refutation | Contradictory evidence at weight 3+ outweighs supporting evidence in both count and average weight |
| Investigation | You have actively attempted to find supporting evidence and failed |

A hypothesis should not be refuted purely because you found no evidence. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. However, if you have specifically designed research to test a hypothesis and the expected signal does not appear after adequate sampling, that is meaningful.

## Diminishing returns

Every additional piece of evidence has diminishing marginal value. The first 5 interviews produce more insight than interviews 15-20. Recognise the signs of diminishing returns:

| Signal | What it means | Action |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| New interviews repeat what you have already heard | You have reached saturation for this segment | Stop interviewing this segment for this hypothesis |
| Additional data confirms existing patterns without adding nuance | Quantitative confirmation is solid | Move to assessment |
| Evidence weight is not increasing with new items | New items are anecdotal (weight 1-2), not additive | Switch methods — try observation or data analysis instead |
| You are interviewing to feel confident, not to learn | Confirmation-seeking behaviour | Check for [bias](/docs/product-discovery/evidence/bias), make the call |

## Sufficiency by hypothesis type

Different hypothesis types require different evidence thresholds because the cost of being wrong differs.

| Hypothesis type | Minimum evidence | Rationale |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Problem hypothesis | 3 items, avg weight 3+ | Core to the discovery — being wrong here invalidates everything downstream |
| User hypothesis | 3 items, avg weight 2.5+ | Important for targeting but can be refined later |
| Context hypothesis | 2 items, avg weight 2.5+ | Contextual — useful for positioning but lower risk if partially wrong |

These are minimums. For high-stakes discoveries (significant investment required, irreversible decisions), increase the thresholds.

## When to stop researching

Use this decision framework:

1. **Have all active hypotheses reached a terminal state (Supported, Refuted, or Retired)?** If yes, research is complete.
2. **Do you have enough Supported hypotheses to form meaningful insights?** If yes, proceed to [Synthesis](/docs/product-discovery/synthesis) — you can always return for more evidence.
3. **Are you past the point of diminishing returns on all active hypotheses?** If yes, make the best call you can with what you have.
4. **Is the cost of additional research greater than the value of additional certainty?** If the decision would be the same at 80% confidence as at 95% confidence, stop.

The goal is not perfect evidence. The goal is enough evidence to make a defensible recommendation in the [Discovery Brief](/docs/product-discovery/templates/discovery-brief). Document your confidence level and what additional evidence would change the recommendation.
