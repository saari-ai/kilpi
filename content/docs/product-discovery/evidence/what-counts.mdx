title: What Counts as Evidence
description: Evidence taxonomy, weight scale, and linking evidence to hypotheses
---

Not everything gathered during research is evidence. A customer saying "that sounds cool" is not evidence of a problem. A customer describing the last time they failed at a task, the workaround they built, and how much time it cost them — that is evidence.

## Evidence taxonomy

Evidence items fall into five categories. Each category has different strengths and typical weight ranges.

### Direct quotes

Verbatim statements from customers captured during interviews or support interactions. These carry the customer's own words and framing.

| Strength | Limitation | Typical weight |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| Captures the customer's perspective authentically | Self-reported — may not reflect actual behaviour | 1-3 |

**Example:** "Every time we get a new enterprise lead, I spend two days scrambling to figure out what security stuff we need. I usually just Google it and pick whatever checklist comes up first." (EV-FN-7)

### Behavioural observations

What you directly observed someone doing, either in person or via session recordings.

| Strength | Limitation | Typical weight |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| Shows actual behaviour, not reported behaviour | Limited sample size, observer may influence behaviour | 2-4 |

**Example:** Participant opened 4 browser tabs, visited 3 different security checklist sites, and spent 22 minutes comparing them before selecting one with no stated rationale for the choice. (EV-FN-12)

### Quantitative data

Numbers from analytics, surveys, market data, or other measured sources.

| Strength | Limitation | Typical weight |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| Objective, scalable, precise | Lacks context — tells you what, not why | 2-5 |

**Example:** 47% of new users who reach the security setup screen abandon it within 60 seconds. Of those who continue, 68% select the default configuration without modification. (EV-FN-15)

### Market signals

Data about the broader market — competitor activity, industry trends, regulatory changes, funding patterns.

| Strength | Limitation | Typical weight |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| Contextualises the opportunity | Indirect — market trends do not prove your specific users have the problem | 1-3 |

**Example:** Three compliance-automation startups raised Series A rounds in the past 12 months, all targeting SMB. Combined funding exceeds $40M. (EV-FN-20)

### Expert opinion

Insights from domain experts, industry analysts, or experienced practitioners.

| Strength | Limitation | Typical weight |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| Deep domain knowledge, pattern recognition | Subject to individual biases and incentives | 1-3 |

**Example:** Security consultant with 50+ SMB clients: "Most small teams implement 2-3 controls that are easy to find online but miss the controls that actually matter for their specific architecture." (EV-FN-22)

## Weight scale

Every evidence item is assigned a weight from 1-5. See [Conventions](/docs/product-discovery/conventions#evidence-weight-scale) for the full scale definition. When assigning weights, apply these guidelines:

| Weight | Assign when | Do not assign when |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Single data point, no corroboration | You have multiple confirming sources (upgrade to 2+) |
| 2 | Multiple data points suggesting a trend | The pattern has been confirmed quantitatively (upgrade to 3+) |
| 3 | Consistent signal across a reasonable sample | The finding is based on a single method only (consider whether 2 is more honest) |
| 4 | Clear pattern confirmed across multiple methods (triangulation) | The quantitative data has methodological issues |
| 5 | Large-sample quantitative data with statistical rigour | You are estimating or extrapolating |

Be conservative. Most discovery evidence lands at weight 2-3. Upgrading to weight 4 requires triangulation. Weight 5 is rare in discovery — it typically requires a dedicated quantitative study.

## Linking evidence to hypotheses

Every evidence item in the [Evidence Register](/docs/product-discovery/templates/evidence-register) must link to at least one hypothesis (PH- reference). The link also indicates direction:

| Direction | Meaning | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Supports | This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis being true | EV-FN-7 supports PH-FN-1 |
| Refutes | This evidence contradicts the hypothesis | EV-FN-15 refutes PH-FN-3 |
| Neutral | This evidence relates to the hypothesis but neither supports nor refutes it | EV-FN-20 is neutral on PH-FN-2 |

An evidence item can support one hypothesis while refuting another. Link it to all relevant hypotheses with the appropriate direction for each.

When you encounter evidence that does not fit any current hypothesis, either:
1. Write a new hypothesis (PH-) that this evidence relates to, or
2. Document it as an unlinked observation — it may become relevant during [Synthesis](/docs/product-discovery/synthesis)
