Execute the methodology in this order:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Problem Framing

Define the problem space, write problem statements, and generate falsifiable hypotheses. Each hypothesis must include what you believe, what evidence would support it, and what evidence would refute it.

Start with at least 3 hypotheses. Each must be falsifiable and scoped to a specific user segment and context. Overly broad hypotheses ("users want a better experience") are not actionable — narrow them until they can be tested.

See [Problem Framing](/docs/product-discovery/problem-framing).
</Step>

<Step>
### Customer Research

Gather evidence through direct engagement with customers and analysis of existing data. Choose research methods based on what you need to learn — use interviews for understanding motivations, observation for understanding behaviour, and data analysis for understanding patterns at scale.

Plan your research before executing it. Define your target segments, screening criteria, and the specific evidence you need to collect. A minimum of 5 interviews per segment is the starting point; you may need more depending on signal clarity.

See [Customer Research](/docs/product-discovery/customer-research).
</Step>

<Step>
### Evidence

Evaluate the evidence you have collected. Weight each piece on a 1-5 scale (Anecdotal to Statistically Significant). Link every evidence item to the hypotheses it supports or refutes. Check for sufficiency — do you have enough evidence to make a call on each hypothesis?

Actively check for bias. Confirmation bias is the most common failure mode in discovery. Use the bias countermeasures defined in the [Bias](/docs/product-discovery/evidence/bias) page.

See [Evidence](/docs/product-discovery/evidence).
</Step>

<Step>
### Opportunity Assessment

Size the opportunity using evidence-based estimates, not aspirational projections. Map the competitive landscape — who else is solving this problem, and how? Assess feasibility across technical, business, and distribution dimensions.

The opportunity assessment turns qualitative evidence into a structured evaluation. Each opportunity gets a score (OP-) that summarises its attractiveness.

See [Opportunity Assessment](/docs/product-discovery/opportunity-assessment).
</Step>

<Step>
### Synthesis

Identify patterns across all evidence. Form insights (IN-) that connect multiple evidence items into actionable understanding. Produce the Discovery Brief — the master output artifact that summarises the problem, evidence, insights, opportunity score, and recommendation.

The Discovery Brief recommends one of three outcomes: proceed to [Product Validation](/docs/product-validation), pivot to a reframed problem, or kill the discovery.

See [Synthesis](/docs/product-discovery/synthesis).
</Step>
</Steps>

## Iteration is expected

The five phases are presented in sequence, but discovery is not strictly linear. Common iteration patterns:

- **Customer Research reshapes Problem Framing.** Early interviews often reveal that your initial problem statement was too broad, too narrow, or pointed at the wrong segment. Go back and reframe.
- **Evidence gaps trigger more Customer Research.** When evaluating evidence sufficiency, you may find that certain hypotheses lack enough data. Run additional interviews or analysis before proceeding.
- **Synthesis happens continuously.** Do not wait until the end to synthesise. After every batch of interviews, look for emerging patterns. Early synthesis sharpens your remaining research.
- **Opportunity Assessment may kill a path early.** If a quick market sizing reveals the opportunity is too small, pivot before investing more in customer research.

The phases give you structure. The iteration keeps you honest. If you never loop back, you are probably not listening to your evidence.
