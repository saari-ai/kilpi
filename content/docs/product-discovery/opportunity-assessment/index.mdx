title: Opportunity Assessment
description: Evaluating the size, competition, and feasibility of validated problem opportunities
---

Opportunity Assessment is the fourth phase of Product Discovery. It answers the question: even if this problem is real and significant, is it worth solving as a business?

A validated problem is necessary but not sufficient. The problem might be real for 50 people, not 50,000. The market might be dominated by an entrenched competitor. The solution might require technology that does not exist yet. Opportunity Assessment adds the business lens to your evidence.

## Relationship to evidence

Opportunity Assessment builds directly on the evidence gathered in previous phases. It does not replace evidence with speculation — it extends evidence-based thinking into market and feasibility dimensions.

| Input | Source | How it is used |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Supported hypotheses | [Problem Framing](/docs/product-discovery/problem-framing) | Define what problem the opportunity addresses |
| Evidence register | [Evidence](/docs/product-discovery/evidence) | Ground market estimates in observed data |
| Insights | [Synthesis](/docs/product-discovery/synthesis) | Connect evidence patterns to market dynamics |

## Scoring criteria

Each opportunity is evaluated across four dimensions. The scores feed into the [Opportunity Scorecard](/docs/product-discovery/templates/opportunity-scorecard).

| Dimension | What it measures | Scoring | See |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|-----|
| Market size | How large is the addressable market? | 1 (niche) to 5 (massive) | [Market Sizing](/docs/product-discovery/opportunity-assessment/market-sizing) |
| Competitive intensity | How crowded and entrenched is the competitive landscape? | 1 (red ocean) to 5 (blue ocean) | [Competitive Landscape](/docs/product-discovery/opportunity-assessment/competitive-landscape) |
| Feasibility | Can this be built and delivered? | 1 (moonshot) to 5 (straightforward) | [Feasibility](/docs/product-discovery/opportunity-assessment/feasibility) |
| Evidence strength | How confident are we in the underlying evidence? | 1 (weak) to 5 (strong) | [Evidence](/docs/product-discovery/evidence) |

The overall opportunity score is the average of all four dimensions, recorded as an OP- item in the [Opportunity Scorecard](/docs/product-discovery/templates/opportunity-scorecard).

### Score interpretation

| Average score | Interpretation | Recommended action |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 4.0 - 5.0 | Strong opportunity | Proceed to [Product Validation](/docs/product-validation) |
| 3.0 - 3.9 | Moderate opportunity | Proceed with caution, or gather more evidence on weak dimensions |
| 2.0 - 2.9 | Weak opportunity | Pivot to a different problem or segment |
| 1.0 - 1.9 | Non-viable | Kill the discovery. Document findings for future reference. |

These are guidelines, not rules. A score of 3.5 with all dimensions at 3-4 is different from a 3.5 with market size at 5 and feasibility at 2. Look at the individual dimension scores, not just the average.

## Process

1. Complete [Market Sizing](/docs/product-discovery/opportunity-assessment/market-sizing) for each opportunity
2. Map the [Competitive Landscape](/docs/product-discovery/opportunity-assessment/competitive-landscape)
3. Assess [Feasibility](/docs/product-discovery/opportunity-assessment/feasibility) across technical, business, and distribution dimensions
4. Calculate evidence strength from the [Evidence Register](/docs/product-discovery/templates/evidence-register) (average weight of supporting evidence for the core hypotheses)
5. Record scores in the [Opportunity Scorecard](/docs/product-discovery/templates/opportunity-scorecard) with an OP- ID
6. Include the scorecard in the [Discovery Brief](/docs/product-discovery/templates/discovery-brief)

## Early kill signals

You do not always need to complete a full opportunity assessment. If any of these signals appear early, consider killing the discovery before investing more effort:

- Market sizing reveals a TAM below your minimum viable threshold
- A dominant competitor has locked up distribution with high switching costs
- Technical feasibility requires a breakthrough that does not currently exist
- Evidence strength is below weight 2 average and further research is not yielding better data

Killing a discovery early is a good outcome. It frees resources for better opportunities.
