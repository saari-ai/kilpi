title: Hypotheses
description: Writing, managing, and evolving falsifiable hypotheses throughout discovery
---

Hypotheses are the core unit of work in Product Discovery. Every research activity, every evidence item, and every insight traces back to a hypothesis. A hypothesis that cannot be proven wrong is not a hypothesis — it is an assumption.

## Format

Every hypothesis follows this structure:

> **We believe [statement]. We'll know this is true when [supporting evidence]. We'll know this is false when [refuting evidence].**

All three components are mandatory:

| Component | Purpose | Common failure |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Statement | What you believe to be true | Too vague: "users want this" instead of "users of [segment] experience [problem] in [context]" |
| Supporting evidence | What would confirm the belief | Too easy to satisfy: "someone agrees" instead of "5+ interviewees independently describe the same behaviour" |
| Refuting evidence | What would disprove the belief | Missing entirely, or set to an impossible bar: "no one disagrees" |

## Hypothesis types

Not all hypotheses test the same thing. Categorising them helps ensure coverage across the problem space.

### Problem hypotheses

Test whether the problem actually exists as described.

> **We believe [solo SaaS founders abandon security setup halfway through] (PH-FN-1). We'll know this is true when [founders describe starting and stopping security tasks during interviews, and analytics show > 50% drop-off in security setup flows]. We'll know this is false when [founders report completing security setup in one session and analytics show > 70% completion rates].**

### User hypotheses

Test assumptions about the user segment — who they are, what they value, how they behave.

> **We believe [the primary users affected are technical founders with 1-3 years of experience, not non-technical founders] (PH-FN-2). We'll know this is true when [the problem appears consistently in interviews with technical founders but not with non-technical founders]. We'll know this is false when [non-technical founders describe the same problem with equal or greater intensity].**

### Context hypotheses

Test when and where the problem occurs — the triggers, environment, and conditions.

> **We believe [the problem is most acute when founders are preparing for their first enterprise customer] (PH-FN-3). We'll know this is true when [founders link security urgency to enterprise sales conversations]. We'll know this is false when [the security problem appears equally across all business stages].**

## Falsifiability

A hypothesis must be falsifiable. This is the most common failure point. Test your hypothesis with these questions:

1. **Can I describe specific evidence that would prove this wrong?** If not, rewrite.
2. **Is the refuting evidence bar achievable?** If refutation requires proving a negative ("no one in the world disagrees"), the bar is too high.
3. **Are the supporting and refuting evidence bars at the same difficulty level?** If it takes 1 interview to confirm but 100 to refute, the hypothesis is biased.
4. **Could someone who disagrees with me design a study that might refute it?** If the hypothesis is structured so that any result confirms it, it is not falsifiable.

### Examples of non-falsifiable hypotheses (do not use)

| Statement | Why it fails |
|-----------|-------------|
| "Users would prefer a better experience" | Any improvement satisfies this. No evidence could refute it. |
| "Some users have this problem" | With a large enough sample, you will always find some. It sets no threshold. |
| "The market is growing" | Unfocused — what market? Growing how? What would refutation look like? |

## Managing the hypothesis backlog

Hypotheses are tracked in the [Problem Hypothesis Log](/docs/product-discovery/templates/problem-hypothesis-log). As discovery progresses, the backlog evolves:

**Adding hypotheses:** New hypotheses emerge during Customer Research. When an interviewee describes a problem you did not anticipate, write a new hypothesis (new PH- ID) and add it to the backlog.

**Splitting hypotheses:** If a hypothesis is too broad to test cleanly (evidence partially supports it and partially refutes it), split it into narrower hypotheses. The original moves to Retired; the new ones get fresh IDs.

**Merging hypotheses:** If two hypotheses are effectively testing the same thing, merge them. Keep the stronger formulation, Retire the other, and consolidate evidence references.

## Lifecycle states

Every hypothesis has a lifecycle state. See [Conventions](/docs/product-discovery/conventions) for the full lifecycle definition and transition rules.

| State | What it means for research |
|-------|---------------------------|
| Draft | Not yet being actively tested. Queued for future research. |
| Active | Currently the target of research activities. Evidence is being gathered. |
| Supported | Enough evidence supports it. Ready to feed into [Synthesis](/docs/product-discovery/synthesis). |
| Refuted | Evidence contradicts it. Document why and move on. |
| Retired | No longer relevant. Superseded, merged, or out of scope. |

Aim to move hypotheses out of Draft quickly. A backlog full of Draft hypotheses means you are generating ideas faster than you are testing them. Prioritise the hypotheses most likely to change your direction and test those first.
