title: Problem Framing
description: Define problem statements and generate falsifiable hypotheses as the foundation for discovery
---

Problem Framing is the first phase of Product Discovery. It transforms a vague problem space into structured, testable statements. Everything downstream — the research you conduct, the evidence you gather, the opportunities you assess — depends on how well you frame the problem here.

A poorly framed problem leads to wasted research. If your problem statement is too broad, you will gather unfocused evidence that does not converge on actionable insights. If it is too narrow, you will miss the real problem.

## What this phase produces

| Artifact | ID scheme | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Problem statements | (no ID — narrative) | Structured descriptions of user problems |
| Problem hypotheses | `PH-{discovery}-{n}` | Falsifiable beliefs to test during Customer Research |

## Inputs

Problem Framing does not start from nothing. Typical inputs include:

- Business observations ("churn is increasing in segment X")
- Customer feedback signals (support tickets, NPS verbatims, social media)
- Market trends or competitor moves
- Internal team intuitions — valid as starting points, but must be converted into testable hypotheses

These inputs become the raw material for [Problem Statements](/docs/product-discovery/problem-framing/problem-statements), which in turn generate [Hypotheses](/docs/product-discovery/problem-framing/hypotheses).

## Completion checklist

Problem Framing is complete when:

- [ ] At least one problem statement is written in the standard format
- [ ] At least 3 hypotheses are written, each in the standard format
- [ ] Every hypothesis is falsifiable — there is a clear way to prove it wrong
- [ ] Every hypothesis is scoped to a specific user segment and context
- [ ] The scope is bounded — you know what is in and out of this discovery
- [ ] A discovery code is assigned and recorded in the [Problem Hypothesis Log](/docs/product-discovery/templates/problem-hypothesis-log)

If you cannot write 3 distinct hypotheses, your problem space may be too narrow. If you can write more than 10, your problem space is probably too broad — split it into multiple discoveries.

## Relationship to other phases

Problem Framing feeds directly into [Customer Research](/docs/product-discovery/customer-research). The hypotheses you generate here determine what questions you ask, who you talk to, and what you observe.

Expect to return to Problem Framing during discovery. Early customer research often reveals that the initial framing was off. This is not failure — it is the methodology working. Reframe, generate new hypotheses (new PH- IDs), and continue.
