title: Synthesis
description: Extracting patterns, forming insights, and producing the Discovery Brief
---

Synthesis is the fifth and final phase of Product Discovery. It transforms raw evidence and individual findings into coherent insights and a clear recommendation. Synthesis is where the discovery converges — everything you have learned is distilled into a Discovery Brief that tells the organisation what to do next.

## Synthesis vs analysis

These terms are often confused. In this methodology, they mean different things:

| | Analysis | Synthesis |
|--|---------|-----------|
| Direction | Breaking things apart | Putting things together |
| Purpose | Understand individual data points | Find connections between data points |
| Output | Evaluated evidence items (EV-) | Insights (IN-), Discovery Brief |
| When | During evidence gathering | After evidence gathering (but also continuously) |

Analysis happens during the [Evidence](/docs/product-discovery/evidence) phase — evaluating quality, assigning weights, checking for bias. Synthesis happens here — connecting evidence items into patterns and patterns into insights.

## Continuous synthesis

Synthesis is listed as the final phase, but it should happen continuously throughout discovery. Do not wait until all research is complete to start looking for patterns.

**After every batch of research (e.g., every 3-5 interviews):**

1. Review the new evidence items in the [Evidence Register](/docs/product-discovery/templates/evidence-register)
2. Look for patterns that were not visible before
3. Update hypothesis states if thresholds have been crossed
4. Identify gaps that need to be filled in the next research batch

**At the end of discovery:**

1. Complete a full synthesis pass across all evidence
2. Form and record insights (IN- items)
3. Produce the [Discovery Brief](/docs/product-discovery/templates/discovery-brief)

Continuous synthesis sharpens your remaining research. If you see a pattern emerging after 5 interviews, your next 5 interviews can be designed to test whether the pattern holds.

## What this phase produces

| Artifact | ID scheme | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Patterns | (no ID — intermediate work) | Groups of related evidence items that point in the same direction |
| Insights | `IN-{discovery}-{n}` | Actionable understanding extracted from patterns |
| Discovery Brief | (no ID — final deliverable) | Master output artifact summarising the entire discovery |

## Process

1. **Map patterns** — group evidence items that relate to the same theme. See [Patterns](/docs/product-discovery/synthesis/patterns).
2. **Form insights** — extract actionable statements from patterns using structured frameworks. See [Insight Frameworks](/docs/product-discovery/synthesis/insight-frameworks).
3. **Compile the Discovery Brief** — assemble evidence, insights, and opportunity assessment into the final deliverable. See [Communicating Findings](/docs/product-discovery/synthesis/communicating-findings).

## Quality checks

Before finalising synthesis, verify:

- [ ] Every insight (IN-) references at least 2 evidence items (EV-)
- [ ] Every insight is actionable — it suggests a direction, not just a description
- [ ] Contradictory evidence has been acknowledged and addressed, not ignored
- [ ] The Discovery Brief recommendation follows logically from the insights and opportunity scores
- [ ] The recommendation is one of: proceed to [Product Validation](/docs/product-validation), pivot, or kill
