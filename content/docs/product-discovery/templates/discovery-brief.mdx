title: Discovery Brief
description: Master output artifact template summarising the entire discovery
---

The Discovery Brief is the primary deliverable of Product Discovery. It summarises the problem, evidence, insights, opportunity assessment, and recommendation in a single document. It is the artifact that gets handed off to [Product Validation](/docs/product-validation) or used to justify a pivot or kill decision.

See [Communicating Findings](/docs/product-discovery/synthesis/communicating-findings) for guidance on how to fill in each section and adapt the brief for different audiences.

## Template

---

### Discovery Brief: [Discovery Name] ([Discovery Code])

**Date:** [Date]
**Author:** [Name/Agent]
**Status:** Draft / Final

---

#### 1. Executive Summary

*3-5 sentences. State the problem, key finding, and recommendation. A reader who reads only this section should know what to do.*

> We investigated [problem area] for [segment]. We found [key finding]. Based on [evidence summary — e.g., "12 interviews, analytics from 2,000 users, and competitive analysis"], we recommend [proceed to validation / pivot / kill].

---

#### 2. Problem Statement

*The validated problem statement. Use the standard format from [Problem Statements](/docs/product-discovery/problem-framing/problem-statements).*

> Users of [segment] struggle with [problem] when [context], which causes [impact].

*If the problem statement evolved during discovery, note what changed and why.*

#### 3. Evidence Summary

**Research scope:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total evidence items | *n* |
| Interviews conducted | *n* |
| Observations completed | *n* |
| Data analyses performed | *n* |
| Research duration | *n weeks* |

**Hypothesis outcomes:**

| ID | Hypothesis | Type | Status | Supporting | Refuting | Avg weight |
|----|-----------|------|--------|------------|----------|------------|
| PH-XX-1 | *Statement* | *Problem / User / Context* | *Supported / Refuted / Retired* | *EV-XX-n, ...* | *EV-XX-n, ...* | *n.n* |
| PH-XX-2 | *Statement* | *Type* | *Status* | *EV refs* | *EV refs* | *n.n* |
| | | | | | | |

**Bias assessment:**

*Note any identified bias risks and whether they were mitigated. Reference the [Bias](/docs/product-discovery/evidence/bias) assessment.*

#### 4. Key Insights

*List each insight in order of importance to the recommendation.*

**IN-XX-1** (*Confidence: High / Medium / Low*):
*Insight statement in JTBD or outcome format.*
Supporting evidence: *EV-XX-n, EV-XX-n, ...*

**IN-XX-2** (*Confidence: High / Medium / Low*):
*Insight statement.*
Supporting evidence: *EV-XX-n, EV-XX-n, ...*

#### 5. Opportunity Score

| Dimension | Score (1-5) | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Market size | | *Brief rationale with evidence reference* |
| Competitive intensity | | *Brief rationale with evidence reference* |
| Feasibility | | *Brief rationale with evidence reference* |
| Evidence strength | | *Based on evidence register metrics* |
| **Overall** | | |

Reference: OP-XX-1 in the [Opportunity Scorecard](/docs/product-discovery/templates/opportunity-scorecard).

#### 6. Recommendation

**Recommendation:** Proceed to validation / Pivot / Kill

*Explain the rationale. Reference the insights and opportunity score that support the recommendation.*

**What would change this recommendation:**

*List the specific evidence or events that would flip the recommendation. This demonstrates intellectual honesty and helps the reader assess risk.*

- *If [specific evidence] emerged, we would [change to different recommendation]*
- *If [assumption] proves false, we would [change to different recommendation]*
