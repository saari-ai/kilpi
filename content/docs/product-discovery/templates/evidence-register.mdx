title: Evidence Register
description: Template for collecting and tracking all evidence items throughout discovery
---

The Evidence Register is the single source of truth for all evidence gathered during discovery. Every interview quote, observation, data point, and market signal is recorded here with a unique ID, weight, and link to the hypotheses it relates to.

See [Evidence](/docs/product-discovery/evidence) for standards on what counts as evidence, how to weight it, and when you have enough. See [Conventions](/docs/product-discovery/conventions) for the evidence weight scale.

#### Evidence items

| ID | Date | Source type | Source detail | Summary | Weight | Direction | Linked hypotheses | Notes |
|----|------|-----------|---------------|---------|--------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| EV-XX-1 | *YYYY-MM-DD* | *interview / observation / analytics / survey / market-data / expert* | *e.g., Interview #3, founding engineer at 5-person SaaS* | *Neutral, factual summary of what was observed or said* | *1-5* | *Supports / Refutes / Neutral* | *PH-XX-1, PH-XX-3* | |
| EV-XX-2 | | | | | | | | |
| EV-XX-3 | | | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | | | |

#### Column definitions

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ID | Unique identifier. Format: `EV-{discovery}-{n}`. Sequential numbering. |
| Date | Date the evidence was collected. |
| Source type | Category of evidence. One of: interview, observation, analytics, survey, market-data, expert. See [What Counts](/docs/product-discovery/evidence/what-counts). |
| Source detail | Specific source without PII. Use roles and segment descriptors, not names. E.g., "Interview #3, solo founder, B2B SaaS, 2 years experience." |
| Summary | Factual description of what was observed or said. For direct quotes, use exact wording in quotation marks. For observations, describe what happened without interpretation. |
| Weight | Evidence strength on the 1-5 scale. See [Conventions](/docs/product-discovery/conventions#evidence-weight-scale). |
| Direction | Supports, Refutes, or Neutral relative to linked hypotheses. If an item supports one hypothesis and refutes another, list it separately for each with the appropriate direction. |
| Linked hypotheses | PH- IDs this evidence relates to. Every item must link to at least one hypothesis. |
| Notes | Interpretation, context, or follow-up questions. Keep this separate from the factual summary. |

#### Evidence by hypothesis

*Pivot table view — helps assess sufficiency per hypothesis.*

| Hypothesis | Supporting items | Refuting items | Neutral items | Total | Avg weight (supporting) |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|-------|------------------------|
| PH-XX-1 | EV-XX-1, EV-XX-4 | EV-XX-7 | EV-XX-10 | 4 | 3.0 |
| PH-XX-2 | | | | | |
| | | | | | |

#### Evidence by source type

*Distribution check — are you relying too heavily on one method?*

| Source type | Count | Percentage |
|------------|-------|------------|
| Interview | | |
| Observation | | |
| Analytics | | |
| Survey | | |
| Market data | | |
| Expert | | |
| **Total** | | |

#### Weight distribution

*Quality check — are your evidence items sufficiently strong?*

| Weight | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| 1 (Anecdotal) | | |
| 2 (Directional) | | |
| 3 (Moderate) | | |
| 4 (Strong) | | |
| 5 (Statistically significant) | | |
| **Total** | | |
