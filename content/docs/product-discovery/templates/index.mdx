description: Fill-in templates for applying the Product Discovery methodology
---

These are the master templates for applying the Product Discovery methodology. Copy the templates when starting a discovery — do not edit the templates directly.

The templates form a connected system. Artifacts created in one template are referenced by others through the ID scheme defined in [Conventions](/docs/product-discovery/conventions).

## Template relationships

```
Problem Hypothesis Log (PH-)
  ↓ hypotheses tested via
Interview Guide (research plan)
  ↓ evidence collected in
Evidence Register (EV-)
  ↓ insights synthesised into
Discovery Brief (IN-, OP-)
  ↑ opportunity scored via
Opportunity Scorecard (OP-)
```

## When to use each template

| Template | When to start | Updated during | Completed by |
|----------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| [Problem Hypothesis Log](/docs/product-discovery/templates/problem-hypothesis-log) | Problem Framing phase | All phases (new hypotheses emerge, states change) | End of Synthesis |
| [Interview Guide](/docs/product-discovery/templates/interview-guide) | Before starting Customer Research | Before each research batch | End of Customer Research |
| [Evidence Register](/docs/product-discovery/templates/evidence-register) | First evidence collected | All research activities | End of Synthesis |
| [Opportunity Scorecard](/docs/product-discovery/templates/opportunity-scorecard) | Opportunity Assessment phase | As new data comes in | End of Opportunity Assessment |
| [Discovery Brief](/docs/product-discovery/templates/discovery-brief) | Synthesis phase | During synthesis | End of discovery |

Start the Problem Hypothesis Log and Interview Guide first. The Evidence Register grows throughout research. The Opportunity Scorecard and Discovery Brief are produced near the end but may be started earlier if early signals are strong enough.
