title: Interview Guide
description: Template for planning and structuring customer research interviews
---

The Interview Guide is a research planning document. Create one before each batch of interviews. It ensures you know what you are trying to learn, who you are talking to, and what evidence you need before you start.

See [Interviews](/docs/product-discovery/customer-research/interviews) for guidance on interview types, question design, and anti-patterns.

## Template

### Interview Guide: [Discovery Name] ([Discovery Code]) — Batch [n]

**Created:** [Date]
**Research type:** Exploratory / Problem / Switching
**Target interviews:** [n]

#### 1. Research objective

*What are you trying to learn in this batch? Be specific.*

> In this batch, we are testing [hypotheses — list PH- IDs]. Specifically, we want to understand [what you need to learn]. We will consider this batch successful if we can [move hypothesis states / identify new patterns / reach saturation on a theme].

#### 2. Target segment

*Who qualifies for this batch?*

| Criterion | Requirement |

#### 4. Interview arc

*Customise the standard arc for this batch. See [Interviews](/docs/product-discovery/customer-research/interviews#interview-arc) for the full arc structure.*

**Rapport (2-3 min):**
- Thank them, explain purpose: "We're researching how [segment] handles [topic]"
- Set expectations: conversation, not a survey. No right answers.

**Context (5-7 min):**
- *List the context questions for this batch*
- "Tell me about your role and what your typical week looks like."
- "What tools do you use for [relevant area]?"
- [Add batch-specific context questions]

**Stories (10-15 min):**
- *List the core story prompts*
- "Tell me about the last time you [relevant activity]."
- "Walk me through what happened."
- [Add batch-specific story prompts targeting PH- hypotheses]

**Specifics (5-10 min):**
- *List the targeted follow-up questions*
- [Questions targeting PH-XX-1]
- [Questions targeting PH-XX-2]
- [Questions targeting PH-XX-3]

**Wrap (2-3 min):**
- "Is there anything you expected me to ask about that I didn't?"
- Thank and close.

#### 5. Evidence goals

*What evidence items do you expect to collect? This helps you recognise relevant data during the interview.*

| Target hypothesis | Evidence you are looking for | Would support | Would refute |
|-------------------|------------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| PH-XX-1 | *Descriptions of [behaviour]* | *If participant describes [X]* | *If participant describes [Y]* |
| PH-XX-2 | *Statements about [topic]* | *If participant says [X]* | *If participant says [Y]* |
| | | | |

#### 6. Post-interview checklist

Complete within 24 hours of each interview:

- [ ] Record evidence items (EV-) in the [Evidence Register](/docs/product-discovery/templates/evidence-register)
- [ ] Assign initial weights to each evidence item
- [ ] Link evidence items to hypotheses (PH-)
- [ ] Note any new hypotheses that emerged (add to [Problem Hypothesis Log](/docs/product-discovery/templates/problem-hypothesis-log))
- [ ] Quick synthesis: does this interview change anything?
