title: Opportunity Scorecard
description: Template for scoring opportunities against consistent criteria
---

The Opportunity Scorecard provides a structured evaluation of each opportunity identified during discovery. It translates qualitative insights and evidence into a comparable score across four dimensions.

See [Opportunity Assessment](/docs/product-discovery/opportunity-assessment) for guidance on each dimension and scoring criteria.

## Template

### Opportunity Scorecard: [Discovery Name] ([Discovery Code])

**Discovery code:** [XX]
**Created:** [Date]
**Last updated:** [Date]

#### Opportunity scores

| ID | Opportunity name | Market size | Competitive intensity | Feasibility | Evidence strength | Overall | Linked insights | Recommendation |
|----|-----------------|-------------|----------------------|-------------|------------------|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| OP-XX-1 | *Short name for the opportunity* | *1-5* | *1-5* | *1-5* | *1-5* | *avg* | *IN-XX-1, IN-XX-2* | *Proceed / Pivot / Kill* |
| OP-XX-2 | | | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | | | |

#### Column definitions

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ID | Unique identifier. Format: `OP-{discovery}-{n}`. |
| Opportunity name | Short, descriptive name for the opportunity. |
| Market size | 1 (niche) to 5 (massive). Based on [Market Sizing](/docs/product-discovery/opportunity-assessment/market-sizing). |
| Competitive intensity | 1 (red ocean) to 5 (blue ocean). Based on [Competitive Landscape](/docs/product-discovery/opportunity-assessment/competitive-landscape). |
| Feasibility | 1 (moonshot) to 5 (straightforward). Average of technical, business, and distribution feasibility. Based on [Feasibility](/docs/product-discovery/opportunity-assessment/feasibility). |
| Evidence strength | 1 (weak) to 5 (strong). Average weight of supporting evidence for the core hypotheses behind this opportunity. |
| Overall | Average of the four dimension scores. |
| Linked insights | IN- IDs that inform this opportunity score. |
| Recommendation | Proceed to [Product Validation](/docs/product-validation), Pivot, or Kill. |

| Total evidence items | *n* |
| Average weight (supporting) | *n.n* |
| Triangulated findings | *n* |
| Bias risks mitigated | *Yes / Partial / No* |

#### Score interpretation

| Average score | Interpretation | Recommended action |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 4.0 - 5.0 | Strong opportunity | Proceed to [Product Validation](/docs/product-validation) |
| 3.0 - 3.9 | Moderate opportunity | Proceed with caution, or investigate weak dimensions |
| 2.0 - 2.9 | Weak opportunity | Pivot to a different problem or segment |
| 1.0 - 1.9 | Non-viable | Kill. Document findings for future reference. |
