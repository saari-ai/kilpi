## ID schemes

We use prefixed ID schemes to uniquely identify validation artifacts across the documentation. The `{solution}` segment in each scheme is a short code for the solution being validated (e.g., FN for FocusNote, PT for PriceTrack). Solution codes are defined in the [Validation Plan](/docs/product-validation/templates/validation-plan) when a validation cycle begins.

### Solution codes

Solution codes are 2-3 uppercase letters derived from the solution name. They must be unique within an organisation's active validation portfolio.

| Rule | Example |
|------|---------|
| Use initials of the solution name | FocusNote → FN |
| For single-word names, use first two letters | Beacon → BE |
| For common prefixes, add a distinguishing letter | FocusNote → FN, FocusBoard → FB |
| Document the code in the Validation Plan header | — |

### Assumption IDs (VA-)

Assumptions are beliefs about the solution that must be true for it to succeed. They are decomposed from the Discovery Brief during the [Hypothesize](/docs/product-validation/phases/hypothesize) phase.

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `VA-{solution}-{number}` | VA-FN-1 | First assumption for FocusNote |

### Hypothesis IDs (VH-)

Hypotheses are testable predictions derived from assumptions. Each hypothesis links to one or more assumptions.

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `VH-{solution}-{number}` | VH-FN-1 | First hypothesis for FocusNote |

### Experiment IDs (VE-)

Experiments are the tests designed to validate or invalidate hypotheses.

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `VE-{solution}-{number}` | VE-FN-1 | First experiment for FocusNote |

### Evidence IDs (VV-)

Evidence items are individual observations or data points collected during experiment execution.

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `VV-{solution}-{number}` | VV-FN-1 | First evidence item for FocusNote |

### Decision IDs (VD-)

Decisions are the culminating artifacts — the verdict on whether to persevere, pivot, or kill.

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `VD-{solution}-{number}` | VD-FN-1 | First decision record for FocusNote |

Multiple decision records for the same solution indicate iteration — a pivot produces a new VD- record referencing the previous one.

## Traceability chain

Every artifact must reference its predecessor in the chain:

```
VA-{solution}-{n}  (Assumption)
  → VH-{solution}-{n}  (Hypothesis — references VA- IDs)
    → VE-{solution}-{n}  (Experiment — references VH- ID)
      → VV-{solution}-{n}  (Evidence — references VE- ID)
        → VD-{solution}-{n}  (Decision — references VV- and VE- IDs)
```

Broken chains indicate gaps in reasoning. If an experiment cannot trace back to an assumption, it is testing something outside the validation scope. If a decision cannot reference evidence, it is a gut call, not a validated decision.

## Confidence levels

We use a five-level confidence scale to assess how strongly evidence supports or refutes a hypothesis:

| Level | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 0 | None | No evidence collected yet |
| 1 | Low | Some evidence but insufficient sample size, conflicting signals, or weak methodology |
| 2 | Medium | Reasonable evidence from a sound experiment; sufficient to make a provisional decision |
| 3 | High | Strong evidence from well-designed experiments with adequate sample sizes |
| 4 | Validated | Overwhelming evidence from multiple experiments; near-certain conclusion |

**Medium** is the minimum confidence required to exit validation with a decision. Lower confidence requires additional experiments. Higher confidence is preferred but not always worth the cost.

## Assumption risk levels

We use a four-level risk scale to prioritize which assumptions to test first:

| Level | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 4 | Critical | If this assumption is wrong, the entire solution fails. Test first. |
| 3 | High | Significant impact on solution success. Test early. |
| 2 | Medium | Moderate impact. Test after critical and high assumptions are resolved. |
| 1 | Low | Minimal impact. May not need explicit testing — monitor during build. |

Risk level is determined by the intersection of **impact** (how badly the solution fails if the assumption is wrong) and **uncertainty** (how confident we are that the assumption is true based on existing evidence).

| | Low Uncertainty | Medium Uncertainty | High Uncertainty |
|---|---|---|---|
| **High Impact** | Medium | High | Critical |
| **Medium Impact** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Low Impact** | Low | Low | Medium |

## Assumption types

Every assumption is categorized into one of four types. This drives technique selection in the [Design](/docs/product-validation/phases/design) phase.

| Type | Code | Tests whether... |
|------|------|-----------------|
| Desirability | D | Users want the solution — they have the problem, they'd use this approach |
| Viability | V | The solution can sustain a business — willingness to pay, unit economics, market size |
| Feasibility | F | The solution can be built — technical capability, regulatory constraints, resource requirements |
| Usability | U | Users can use the solution — learnability, efficiency, error tolerance |
