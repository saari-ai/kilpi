## Decision header

```
VD-ID:          VD-FN-1
Solution:       FocusNote
Solution code:  FN
Date:           2026-02-22
Validation plan: VP-FN-1
Previous VD:    N/A (first validation cycle)
```

## Evidence summary

| VE-ID | Hypothesis tested | Method | Result | Confidence | Key evidence |
|-------|------------------|--------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| VE-FN-1 | VH-FN-1 (Desirability) | Landing page test | Pass | High | VV-FN-5: 9.4% conversion (523 visitors). VV-FN-6: Top signup reason aligns with Discovery Brief. |
| VE-FN-2 | VH-FN-2 (Feasibility/Usability) | Wizard of Oz | Pass | Medium | VV-FN-9: 9/10 rated useful. VV-FN-10: 8/10 used for study. VV-FN-12: Attention detection feasible for 70% of users. |
| VE-FN-3 | VH-FN-3 (Viability) | Pocket test | Fail (leaning) | High | VV-FN-18: 8.2% pre-purchase (below 15% threshold). VV-FN-19: Price is the barrier, not interest. |

## Assumption outcomes

| VA-ID | Assumption | Type | Risk level | Final status | Evidence |
|-------|-----------|------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| VA-FN-1 | Students with ADHD want an AI-powered note-taking tool | D | High | Validated | VE-FN-1 (9.4% conversion) |
| VA-FN-2 | Value proposition is compelling enough to drive signups | D | High | Validated | VE-FN-1 (9.4% conversion, VV-FN-6 survey data) |
| VA-FN-3 | AI can detect attention patterns from typing cadence | F | Critical | Validated (proxy) | VE-FN-2 (VV-FN-12: worked for 70% of students) |
| VA-FN-4 | Students will trust AI-generated summaries | U | High | Validated | VE-FN-2 (VV-FN-9: 9/10 useful, VV-FN-10: 8/10 used for study) |
| VA-FN-5 | Students will pay $10/month | V | Critical | Invalidated | VE-FN-3 (VV-FN-18: 8.2% conversion. VV-FN-19: price is barrier) |
| VA-FN-6 | Student acquisition via university channels is sustainable | V | Medium | Untested | Not tested in this cycle |

## Overall confidence

```
Overall confidence level: Medium
Critical assumptions resolved: 2 of 2
  - VA-FN-3 (Feasibility): Validated via proxy (Medium confidence)
  - VA-FN-5 (Viability): Invalidated (High confidence)
Conflicting evidence: None — all evidence is directionally consistent
```

## Decision

```
Decision:    Pivot (Value Capture)
```

### Pivot details

```
Pivot type:    Value capture

What stays (validated learnings):
  - VA-FN-1: Students with ADHD want an AI-powered note-taking tool (High confidence)
  - VA-FN-2: The value proposition drives signups (High confidence)
  - VA-FN-4: Students trust and use AI-generated summaries (Medium confidence)
  - VA-FN-3: Attention detection from typing patterns is feasible for ~70% of users (Medium confidence)

What changes:
  - Revenue model shifts from $10/month subscription to freemium:
    - Free tier: basic AI summaries for up to 3 lectures/week
    - Pro tier: unlimited lectures, advanced features (export, collaboration), at $4-5/month
  - This addresses the core failure: students want the product but $10/month exceeds
    their budget. Qualitative evidence (VV-FN-19) suggests $3-5/month is the acceptable range.
    Freemium also addresses the "I want to try it first" objection (VV-FN-17).

New assumptions to test:
  - VA-FN-7: Students will convert from free to Pro at $4.99/month at ≥ 5% conversion
  - VA-FN-8: Free tier usage is sufficient to demonstrate value and drive upgrades
  - VA-FN-9: Unit economics are sustainable with freemium (CAC < LTV at projected conversion rates)

Next validation cycle:
  Create a new Validation Plan (VP-FN-2) with solution code FN, referencing VD-FN-1.
  Focus experiments on the new viability assumptions (VA-FN-7, VA-FN-8, VA-FN-9).
  Desirability and usability assumptions carry forward as validated — do not re-test.
```

## Rationale

The evidence strongly supports that FocusNote solves a real problem that students care about. Desirability is validated with High confidence (9.4% landing page conversion, strong qualitative alignment with Discovery evidence). Usability is validated with Medium confidence (9/10 found summaries useful, 8/10 used them for study). Feasibility is validated via proxy with Medium confidence (attention detection worked for 70% of users).

The critical failure is viability at the $10/month price point. However, the qualitative evidence from VE-FN-3 is unambiguous: students are not rejecting the product, they are rejecting the price. Four out of seven reply emails cited cost as the barrier. One specifically suggested $3-5/month. Two wanted a free trial. Zero said the product was not interesting.

This is a textbook value capture pivot — the product is right, the revenue model is wrong. A freemium model addresses both the price barrier and the "try before you buy" objection. The pivot preserves all validated learnings while attacking the specific assumption that failed.

Kill was considered but rejected because: (1) the desirability and usability evidence is strong, (2) the failure is clearly in pricing, not product-market fit, and (3) a concrete alternative pricing model exists with supportive qualitative evidence.
