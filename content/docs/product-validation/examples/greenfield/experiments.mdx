### Evidence log

| VV-ID | Date | Source | Type | Observation | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|------|------------|-------|
| VV-FN-1 | 2026-01-23 | Google Analytics | Quant | 142 visitors in first 3 days, 15 signups (10.6%) | Higher than expected — early traffic may be more motivated |
| VV-FN-2 | 2026-01-27 | Google Analytics | Quant | Cumulative: 312 visitors, 31 signups (9.9%). Bounce rate 52%. | Conversion stabilizing around 10% |
| VV-FN-3 | 2026-01-28 | TikTok Analytics | Quant | TikTok ad CTR: 2.3%. Instagram ad CTR: 1.1%. TikTok driving 68% of traffic. | TikTok audience more responsive — potential channel signal |
| VV-FN-4 | 2026-02-01 | Google Analytics | Quant | Cumulative: 487 visitors, 47 signups (9.7%). Bounce rate 54%. | Approaching sample size target |
| VV-FN-5 | 2026-02-03 | Google Analytics | Quant | Final: 523 visitors, 49 signups (9.4%). Bounce rate 53%. Avg time on page: 1m42s. | Experiment complete — sample size met |
| VV-FN-6 | 2026-02-03 | Signup survey | Qual | 38 of 49 signups completed a 2-question survey. Top reason for signing up: "I lose so much during lectures" (24 responses). Second: "AI sounds interesting" (9 responses). | Desirability signal aligns with Discovery Brief |

### Result

```
Primary metric result:    9.4% conversion (49/523)
Secondary metric result:  53% bounce rate
Outcome:                  Pass
Confidence level:         High
Confounding factors:      None identified — traffic sources were targeted and representative
Evaluator notes:          Conversion exceeded 8% threshold with good sample size. Bounce rate
                          well below 60%. TikTok outperformed Instagram as an acquisition
                          channel — relevant for VA-FN-6 though not directly tested. Strong
                          desirability signal.

```

### Success criteria

| Metric | Pass threshold | Fail threshold | Inconclusive range |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Summary usefulness rating | ≥ 7 of 10 rate "useful" or "very useful" | < 4 of 10 rate "useful" or "very useful" | 4-7 of 10 |
| Study usage | ≥ 6 of 10 use summaries for exam prep | < 3 of 10 use summaries | 3-6 of 10 |

### Experiment parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Sample size (minimum) | 10 students |
| Duration (maximum) | 10 days (covering 2 lectures per student) |
| Cost budget | $500 (participant incentives at $50 each) |
| Target audience | University students with ADHD, recruited from landing page signups |
| Tools / platforms | Google Docs (shared note), human summarizer (team member), post-session survey |

### Description

10 students from the landing page waitlist were recruited to participate in a "beta test" of FocusNote. During their lectures, they took notes in a shared Google Doc. A team member observed the typing patterns (simulating AI attention detection) and manually generated summaries of content during apparent attention drops — inserting them as highlighted blocks in the student's document. Students were told the summaries were AI-generated. After each lecture, students rated the summaries. After two lectures, students reported whether they used the summaries for study.

### Evidence log

| VV-ID | Date | Source | Type | Observation | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|------|------------|-------|
| VV-FN-7 | 2026-02-07 | Post-lecture survey 1 | Quant | After first lecture: 8 of 10 rated summaries "useful" or "very useful". 2 rated "neutral". | Strong initial signal |
| VV-FN-8 | 2026-02-07 | Post-lecture interview | Qual | P3: "This is exactly what I need — I looked down at my phone for 2 minutes and the summary caught what I missed." P7: "The summary was good but I wasn't sure it got the nuance right." | Trust concern from P7 worth tracking |
| VV-FN-9 | 2026-02-12 | Post-lecture survey 2 | Quant | After second lecture: 9 of 10 rated "useful" or "very useful". 1 rated "neutral" (P7 again). | Improvement from lecture 1 — familiarity effect |
| VV-FN-10 | 2026-02-14 | Study usage survey | Quant | 8 of 10 reported using the summaries for exam prep. 2 said they "looked at them but used their own notes primarily." | Passes study usage threshold |
| VV-FN-11 | 2026-02-14 | Post-experiment interview | Qual | P2: "I started relying on FocusNote to catch what I miss. I actually stopped stressing about every attention lapse." P10: "I would want to edit the summaries — sometimes the AI misses context I care about." | P10's feedback reveals a usability need: editability |
| VV-FN-12 | 2026-02-16 | Observation notes | Qual | Human summarizer found attention detection was feasible via typing patterns — long pauses (>15s) followed by rapid typing correlated with attention recovery in 7 of 10 students. 3 students had irregular patterns that were harder to interpret. | Feasibility signal: pattern detection works for 70% of users. 30% may need alternative detection methods. |

### Result

```
Primary metric result:    9 of 10 rated "useful" or "very useful" (lecture 2)
Secondary metric result:  8 of 10 used summaries for study
Outcome:                  Pass
Confidence level:         Medium
Confounding factors:      Hawthorne effect likely — students knew they were in a study and
                          may have been more positive. Human summaries may be higher quality
                          than AI would produce. Small sample (10 students).
Evaluator notes:          Both metrics pass thresholds. Key insight: students want editability
                          (VV-FN-12). Feasibility proxy positive but with 30% edge case
                          concern. Confidence is Medium (not High) due to small sample and
                          Hawthorne effect. VA-FN-3 validated via proxy — real AI performance
                          remains a build-phase risk.

## VE-FN-3: Pocket Test (Willingness to Pay)

### Header

```
VE-ID:              VE-FN-3
Linked hypothesis:  VH-FN-3
Linked assumptions: VA-FN-5
Method:             Pocket test (willingness to pay)
Fidelity level:     Level 2-3
Date designed:      2026-02-04
Date started:       2026-02-10
Date completed:     2026-02-20
Status:             Complete
```

### Success criteria

| Metric | Pass threshold | Fail threshold | Inconclusive range |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Pre-purchase commitment rate | ≥ 15% of contacted signups | < 5% of contacted signups | 5% - 15% |

### Experiment parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Sample size (minimum) | 40 qualified leads (from 49 landing page signups) |
| Duration (maximum) | 10 days |
| Cost budget | $0 (email-only, no ad spend) |
| Target audience | Landing page signups (VE-FN-1 waitlist) |
| Tools / platforms | Email, Stripe payment link ($10 refundable pre-order) |

### Description

Emailed all 49 landing page signups offering early access to FocusNote at $10/month. The email described the product (consistent with the landing page), explained the pre-order model (charged $10 now, refundable if the product does not launch within 6 months, first month free at launch). Included a Stripe payment link. Follow-up email sent on Day 5 to non-responders.

### Evidence log

| VV-ID | Date | Source | Type | Observation | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|------|------------|-------|
| VV-FN-13 | 2026-02-12 | Email analytics | Quant | 49 emails sent. 38 opened (78% open rate). 14 clicked the payment link (29% of opens, 37% of signups). | High open rate — engaged audience |
| VV-FN-14 | 2026-02-14 | Stripe | Quant | After initial email: 3 of 49 completed payment ($10 pre-order). 6.1% conversion. | Below pass threshold |
| VV-FN-15 | 2026-02-15 | Email analytics | Quant | Follow-up email sent to 46 non-purchasers. 29 opened. 8 clicked payment link. | Decent re-engagement |
| VV-FN-16 | 2026-02-18 | Stripe | Quant | After follow-up: 1 additional payment. Total: 4 of 49 (8.2%). | Still below 15% threshold |
| VV-FN-17 | 2026-02-18 | Email replies | Qual | 7 replies explaining why they didn't purchase. Common themes: "I can't afford $10/month as a student" (4 replies), "I want to try it first" (2 replies), "I'd pay but less" (1 reply). | Price sensitivity signal — not lack of interest |
| VV-FN-18 | 2026-02-20 | Stripe | Quant | Final: 4 of 49 pre-ordered (8.2%). No additional purchases after Day 8. | Experiment complete |
| VV-FN-19 | 2026-02-20 | Reply analysis | Qual | Of the 7 who replied: 4 cited price as barrier, not value. 1 said "I'd pay $3-5/month." 2 wanted a free trial. 0 said the product wasn't interesting. | Desirability intact — viability at this price point fails |

### Result

```
Primary metric result:    8.2% pre-purchase (4/49)
Outcome:                  Inconclusive (between 5% fail and 15% pass)
                          Leaning Fail when combined with qualitative evidence
Confidence level:         High
Confounding factors:      Small absolute numbers (4 purchases from 49 leads). However,
                          qualitative evidence is strong and consistent — price is the
                          barrier, not interest.
Evaluator notes:          Quantitatively inconclusive (8.2% is between thresholds). However,
                          qualitative evidence clearly points to price sensitivity, not lack
                          of demand. Students want the product but $10/month exceeds their
                          budget. Combined with VE-FN-1 (strong desirability) and VE-FN-2
                          (strong usability), the pattern is clear: the product is wanted but
                          the price is wrong. This is a viability failure, not a desirability
                          failure. Confidence is High because quantitative and qualitative
                          evidence converge on the same conclusion.
