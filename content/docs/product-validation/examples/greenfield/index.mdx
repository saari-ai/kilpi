description: Worked example — validating an AI-powered note-taking app for students with ADHD
---

FocusNote is a fictional product used to demonstrate the Product Validation methodology end-to-end. It shows a complete validation cycle with mixed results leading to a Pivot decision.

## Product concept

FocusNote is an AI-powered note-taking assistant designed for university students with ADHD. It detects attention patterns from typing cadence and interaction behavior, then generates intelligent summaries of lecture content during moments when focus drops. The goal is to ensure students never miss critical information during attention lapses.

## Discovery Brief summary

[Product Discovery](/docs/product-discovery) produced a Discovery Brief (DB-FN-1) that established:

- **Problem:** University students with ADHD consistently lose critical lecture information during attention lapses. They spend an average of 40 minutes after each lecture reorganizing and filling gaps in their notes. Existing note-taking tools (Notion, Google Docs, traditional notebooks) do not accommodate variable attention patterns.
- **User segment:** University students diagnosed with or self-identifying as having ADHD, aged 18-25, enrolled in lecture-heavy courses.
- **Opportunity score:** OP-FN-1 scored above threshold based on frequency (daily), intensity (high frustration), and willingness to seek solutions (85% of interviewed students had tried 3+ tools).
- **Proposed solution direction:** An AI-powered note-taking app that detects attention patterns and automatically generates summaries of content during attention drops.
- **Key Discovery evidence:** 15 interviews, 120 survey responses. 85% of students with ADHD want better lecture note tools. 72% report losing information during attention lapses. 60% would consider an AI-based solution.

## What this example demonstrates

| Phase | What you'll see |
|-------|----------------|
| [Validation Plan](/docs/product-validation/examples/greenfield/validation-plan) | 6 assumptions decomposed from the Discovery Brief, categorized by type, prioritized by risk, with corresponding hypotheses |
| [Experiments](/docs/product-validation/examples/greenfield/experiments) | 3 experiments at different fidelity levels — a landing page test, a Wizard of Oz test, and a pocket test — with full evidence logs and mixed results |
| [Decision](/docs/product-validation/examples/greenfield/decision) | A Pivot decision (value capture) — desirability validated but viability failed at $10/mo, leading to a freemium model pivot |

## Key takeaway

FocusNote demonstrates that validation is not about confirming what you want to be true. The landing page test confirmed desirability. The Wizard of Oz test revealed a crucial usability insight. But the pocket test showed students would not pay $10/month — forcing an honest pivot rather than wishful perseverance. The traceability chain makes the reasoning transparent and defensible.
