description: Worked examples showing the Product Validation methodology applied end-to-end
---

Examples demonstrate the methodology applied to realistic products with filled-in artifacts, real data, and genuine decisions. They are not toy examples — they show the messy reality of validation including mixed results, inconclusive evidence, and pivot decisions.

## Available examples

| Example | Type | Solution | Decision outcome | Key learning |
|---------|------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| [FocusNote](/docs/product-validation/examples/greenfield) | Greenfield product | AI-powered note-taking for students with ADHD | Pivot (value capture) | Desirability validated, viability failed at $10/mo — switched to freemium |

## How to use examples

1. **Read the overview** to understand the product and what the Discovery Brief established.
2. **Study the Validation Plan** to see how assumptions were decomposed, categorized, and prioritized.
3. **Walk through the Experiments** to see how techniques were chosen, criteria were set, and evidence was collected.
4. **Read the Decision** to see how evidence led to a specific outcome — including what the team learned from failed experiments.

Examples are reference implementations. When applying the methodology to your own product, use the same structure but adapt the content to your context. The [Templates](/docs/product-validation/templates) provide the blank versions.
