description: Execution order, entry conditions, and exit conditions for applying the Product Validation methodology

import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

## Entry condition

Product Validation begins when you have a **Discovery Brief** from [Product Discovery](/docs/product-discovery) with a validated problem or opportunity. The brief must contain:

- A problem statement with validated user evidence
- An opportunity score (OP-) at or above the team's threshold
- Identified user segments affected
- A proposed solution direction (even if rough)

Do not start validation without a Discovery Brief. Testing solutions to unvalidated problems wastes cycles and produces misleading evidence.

## Execution order

Execute the methodology in this order:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Hypothesize (HY)

Decompose the Discovery Brief into explicit assumptions. Categorize each assumption by type (desirability, viability, feasibility, usability). Prioritize by risk using the impact x uncertainty matrix. Form testable hypotheses for the highest-risk assumptions first.

See [Hypothesize](/docs/product-validation/phases/hypothesize).
</Step>

<Step>
### Design (DE)

For each hypothesis, design an experiment. Choose the minimum fidelity level that can test the hypothesis. Define quantitative success criteria before execution — never after. Set sample sizes, durations, and cost budgets. Produce experiment cards ready for execution.

See [Design](/docs/product-validation/phases/design).
</Step>

<Step>
### Execute (EX)

Run experiments following the protocol defined in Design. Do not change success criteria mid-experiment. Collect data and log evidence entries with timestamps, sources, and observations. Maintain execution integrity — the goal is truth, not confirmation.

See [Execute](/docs/product-validation/phases/execute).
</Step>

<Step>
### Evaluate (EV)

Assess collected evidence against the pre-defined success criteria. Determine signal vs noise. Assign a confidence level (None → Low → Medium → High → Validated) to each experiment result. Determine whether you have sufficient evidence to make a decision or need additional experiments.

See [Evaluate](/docs/product-validation/phases/evaluate).
</Step>

<Step>
### Decide (DC)

Using the evaluated evidence, make a decision for the solution: Persevere, Pivot, or Kill. Document the decision in a formal Decision Record (VD-) with evidence references, confidence level, rationale, and next actions. If pivoting, specify the pivot type and initiate a new validation cycle.

See [Decide](/docs/product-validation/phases/decide).
</Step>
</Steps>

## Exit condition

Product Validation is complete when you have a **VD- Decision Record** with:

- Confidence level of **Medium** or higher
- A clear decision: Persevere, Pivot (with type), or Kill
- Referenced evidence chain (VV- → VE- → VH- → VA-)
- Defined next actions

If the decision is **Persevere**, the Decision Record becomes the handoff to engineering with build specifications. If the decision is **Pivot**, a new validation cycle begins with revised assumptions. If the decision is **Kill**, the learnings are archived and the team returns to [Product Discovery](/docs/product-discovery) for a new solution direction.

## Iteration

Validation is not always a single pass. Common iteration patterns:

- **Insufficient evidence:** Evaluate phase determines confidence is too low. Return to Design to create additional experiments.
- **Partial validation:** Some assumptions validate, others fail. Return to Hypothesize to re-prioritize and form new hypotheses around the failing assumptions.
- **Pivot loop:** Decide phase produces a Pivot. The pivot generates new assumptions, starting a fresh Hypothesize → Design → Execute → Evaluate → Decide cycle.

Each iteration maintains traceability — new artifacts reference the originals they supersede.
