title: Hypothesize
description: Phase HY — decompose Discovery Brief into assumptions, prioritize by risk, form testable hypotheses
---

## Purpose

The Hypothesize phase takes the Discovery Brief from [Product Discovery](/docs/product-discovery) and decomposes the proposed solution into explicit, testable assumptions. It then prioritizes those assumptions by risk and converts the highest-risk assumptions into formal hypotheses.

**Input:** Discovery Brief with validated problem, user segments, and proposed solution direction.

**Output:** Prioritized assumption register (VA-) and hypothesis set (VH-).

## Assumption mapping

Start by listing every belief that must be true for the proposed solution to succeed. Be exhaustive — implicit assumptions are the ones that kill products.

### Decomposition process

1. Read the Discovery Brief's problem statement and proposed solution direction.
2. For each element of the solution, ask: "What must be true for this to work?"
3. Categorize each assumption by type (see below).
4. Assign an ID: `VA-{solution}-{n}` in discovery order.

### Assumption types

Every assumption falls into one of four categories. This categorization drives technique selection in the [Design](/docs/product-validation/phases/design) phase.

| Type | Code | Question it answers | Examples |
|------|------|-------------------|----------|
| Desirability | D | Do users want this? | "Students want AI-generated note summaries" |
| Viability | V | Can this sustain a business? | "Students will pay $10/month for this service" |
| Feasibility | F | Can we build this? | "AI can detect attention patterns from typing cadence" |
| Usability | U | Can users use this? | "Students will trust and act on AI-generated summaries" |

### Common assumption sources

| Solution element | Typical assumptions |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Target user | Users in this segment actually have the problem (D), they are reachable through the planned channel (V) |
| Core mechanism | The proposed mechanism works as expected (F), users understand how to use it (U) |
| Value proposition | Users perceive the value as described (D), the value is differentiated from alternatives (D) |
| Revenue model | Users will pay the proposed price (V), unit economics are sustainable (V) |
| Technology | Required technology exists or can be built within constraints (F), performance meets user expectations (F) |
| Distribution | Target users can be reached cost-effectively (V), the acquisition channel scales (V) |

## Risk prioritization

Not all assumptions are equal. Prioritize by risk using the impact x uncertainty matrix defined in [Conventions](/docs/product-validation/conventions).

### Scoring assumptions

For each assumption, assess two dimensions:

**Impact** — How badly does the solution fail if this assumption is wrong?
- High: Solution is dead. No workaround exists.
- Medium: Solution is degraded. Workarounds exist but they reduce value.
- Low: Solution still works. Minor adjustments needed.

**Uncertainty** — How confident are we that this assumption is true, based on existing evidence?
- High: No evidence. Pure speculation.
- Medium: Some indirect evidence (market analogies, Discovery Brief signals).
- Low: Strong evidence from Discovery or prior work.

The intersection determines risk level (Critical, High, Medium, Low). See the [risk matrix](/docs/product-validation/conventions#assumption-risk-levels).

### Prioritization rules

1. Test **Critical** assumptions first. If a Critical assumption fails, nothing else matters.
2. Test **High** assumptions next. These can be run in parallel if resources allow.
3. **Medium** assumptions are tested if time and budget permit, or deferred to early build.
4. **Low** assumptions are monitored during build, not explicitly tested in validation.

## Hypothesis formation

Convert each assumption being tested into a formal hypothesis using the standard format:

```
If [specific action or change],
then [measurable outcome],
because [rationale from Discovery Brief].
```

### Hypothesis rules

- Every hypothesis must be **falsifiable**. If no experiment result could disprove it, it is not a hypothesis.
- Every hypothesis must reference at least one VA- assumption.
- The "measurable outcome" must be quantifiable or clearly observable. "Users like it" is not measurable. "7 out of 10 users complete the onboarding flow without assistance" is measurable.
- The "rationale" ties back to the Discovery Brief, grounding the hypothesis in validated user evidence.

### Example

| ID | Hypothesis | Linked assumptions |
|----|-----------|-------------------|
| VH-FN-1 | If we present a landing page describing AI-powered note summaries, then at least 8% of visitors will sign up for the waitlist, because Discovery interviews showed 85% of students with ADHD want better lecture note tools. | VA-FN-1, VA-FN-2 |
| VH-FN-2 | If we provide human-generated summaries disguised as AI summaries during lectures, then 7 out of 10 students will rate them as "useful" or "very useful," because students reported spending 40min+ reorganizing notes after class. | VA-FN-3, VA-FN-5 |

## Output

The Hypothesize phase produces two artifacts:

1. **Assumption Register** — A table of all VA- items with type, risk level, and links to Discovery Brief evidence. Lives in the [Validation Plan](/docs/product-validation/templates/validation-plan).
2. **Hypothesis Set** — Formal VH- hypotheses for each assumption being tested, with the standard if/then/because format. Also lives in the Validation Plan.

These feed directly into the [Design](/docs/product-validation/phases/design) phase, where each hypothesis gets an experiment card.
