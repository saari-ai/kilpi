title: Phases
description: The five phases of Product Validation and their relationships
---

Product Validation operates as a five-phase pipeline. Each phase has defined inputs, outputs, and key artifacts. Phases execute sequentially, though iteration loops are common — see [Getting Started](/docs/product-validation/getting-started) for iteration patterns.

## Phase overview

| Phase | Code | Input | Output | Key artifacts |
|-------|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| [Hypothesize](/docs/product-validation/phases/hypothesize) | HY | Discovery Brief | Prioritized assumption register + hypothesis set | VA- assumption register, VH- hypothesis cards |
| [Design](/docs/product-validation/phases/design) | DE | Prioritized hypotheses | Experiment cards ready for execution | VE- experiment cards with success criteria |
| [Execute](/docs/product-validation/phases/execute) | EX | Experiment cards | Evidence log entries | VV- evidence items |
| [Evaluate](/docs/product-validation/phases/evaluate) | EV | Evidence log + success criteria | Evaluated results with confidence levels | Experiment results (pass/fail/inconclusive) |
| [Decide](/docs/product-validation/phases/decide) | DC | Evaluated results | Decision record | VD- decision record |

## Phase rules

1. **Phases execute in order.** Do not skip ahead — designing experiments before mapping assumptions leads to testing the wrong things.
2. **Success criteria are set in Design, not Evaluate.** Moving the goalposts after seeing results is the most common validation failure.
3. **Every artifact references its predecessor.** VH- references VA-. VE- references VH-. VV- references VE-. VD- references VV- and VE-. Broken chains indicate gaps.
4. **Minimum viable fidelity.** Always choose the lowest-fidelity experiment that can test the hypothesis. Do not build a prototype when a landing page test suffices.
5. **Pivot is not failure.** A pivot is a validated learning. The methodology treats Kill, Pivot, and Persevere as equally valid outcomes — the goal is truth, not confirmation.
