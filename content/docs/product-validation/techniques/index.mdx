description: How to choose the right validation technique by fidelity level and assumption type
---

The [Technique Catalog](/docs/product-validation/techniques/catalog) provides 15 validation methods. This page explains how to select the right technique for a given hypothesis.

## Selection framework

Technique selection is driven by two factors:

1. **Assumption type** — What kind of assumption is the hypothesis testing? (Desirability, Viability, Feasibility, Usability)
2. **Minimum viable fidelity** — What is the lowest-fidelity technique that can produce credible evidence for this hypothesis?

Always start with the lowest fidelity that fits. Escalate only when lower-fidelity results are inconclusive or when the assumption type demands user interaction.

## Selection matrix

| Assumption type | Level 1: Smoke test | Level 2: Wizard of Oz | Level 3: Prototype | Level 4: Concierge | Level 5: MVP |
|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----|
| **Desirability** | Landing page, Fake door, Painted door, Explainer video | Customer interview (solution) | Clickable prototype | Concierge | MVP |
| **Viability** | Pre-order, Crowdfunding | Pocket test | A/B test (pricing) | Concierge | MVP |
| **Feasibility** | — | Wizard of Oz | Paper prototype, Clickable prototype | Concierge | MVP |
| **Usability** | — | Wizard of Oz | Prototype usability test, Paper prototype | Concierge | MVP |

Cells marked "—" indicate that the fidelity level is generally too low to produce meaningful evidence for that assumption type.

## Decision flow

Use this flow to select a technique:

1. **Identify the assumption type** from the hypothesis card (D, V, F, U).
2. **Start at the lowest fidelity column** in the matrix above.
3. **Check if a technique in that cell fits the hypothesis.** Can the technique produce evidence that directly addresses the hypothesis's "measurable outcome"?
4. **If yes, select it.** Define success criteria in the [Design](/docs/product-validation/phases/design) phase.
5. **If no, move one column right** (next fidelity level) and repeat.

## Combining techniques

Some hypotheses benefit from multiple techniques at different fidelity levels:

- **Sequential escalation:** Run a Level 1 smoke test first. If it passes, escalate to Level 2-3 for deeper validation. This avoids spending on high-fidelity tests for ideas that fail basic demand testing.
- **Parallel triangulation:** Run a quantitative test (landing page) and a qualitative test (solution interview) simultaneously. Converging evidence increases confidence beyond what either test achieves alone.
- **Type coverage:** A desirability test (landing page) + viability test (pocket test) + usability test (prototype) covers three assumption types for the same solution. This is a common pattern for a full validation cycle.

## Technique fit assessment

Before committing to a technique, verify fit:

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| Evidence type match | Does the technique produce the kind of evidence the hypothesis needs? (quantitative vs qualitative) |
| Sample size feasibility | Can you reach the required sample size with available resources and time? |
| Audience access | Can you reach the target user segment through this technique? |
| Budget alignment | Does the technique fit within the experiment's cost budget? |
| Ethical considerations | Does the technique require deception that could damage trust? (e.g., fake door tests on existing customers) |

If any check fails, select a different technique — do not force a poor fit.
