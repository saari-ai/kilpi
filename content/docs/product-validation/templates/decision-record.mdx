title: Decision Record
description: Culminating artifact template — evidence summary, confidence, decision, rationale, and next actions
---

The Decision Record is the culminating artifact of a validation cycle. It documents the evidence-backed decision to Persevere, Pivot, or Kill. Created during the [Decide](/docs/product-validation/phases/decide) phase.

## Decision header

```
VD-ID:          [VD-{solution}-{n}]
Solution:       [Solution name]
Solution code:  [{solution code}]
Date:           [YYYY-MM-DD]
Validation plan: [Reference to the Validation Plan]
Previous VD:    [VD-{solution}-{n-1} if this is a pivot iteration, otherwise N/A]
```

## Evidence summary

Reference all experiments and their results. This is the evidentiary basis for the decision.

| VE-ID | Hypothesis tested | Method | Result | Confidence | Key evidence (VV-IDs) |
|-------|------------------|--------|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| `VE-{sol}-1` | `VH-{sol}-1` | [Method] | Pass/Fail/Inconclusive | None-Validated | `VV-{sol}-1`, `VV-{sol}-2` |
| `VE-{sol}-2` | `VH-{sol}-2` | [Method] | Pass/Fail/Inconclusive | None-Validated | `VV-{sol}-3`, `VV-{sol}-4` |

## Assumption outcomes

Summarize the status of each assumption after all experiments:

| VA-ID | Assumption | Type | Risk level | Final status | Evidence |
|-------|-----------|------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `VA-{sol}-1` | [Assumption text] | D/V/F/U | Critical/High/Medium/Low | Validated/Invalidated/Inconclusive | [VE-IDs that tested it] |
| `VA-{sol}-2` | | | | | |

## Overall confidence

```
Overall confidence level: [None | Low | Medium | High | Validated]
Critical assumptions resolved: [n of n]
Conflicting evidence:          [None | Description]
```

## Decision

```
Decision:    [Persevere | Pivot ({type}) | Kill]
```

### If Persevere

```
Validated assumptions to carry into build:
  - [VA-{sol}-{n}: assumption text]
  - [VA-{sol}-{n}: assumption text]

Remaining risks to monitor during build:
  - [VA-{sol}-{n}: assumption text — Medium confidence, monitor via {method}]

Build handoff notes:
  [Key specifications, constraints, and validated parameters for the engineering team]
```

### If Pivot

```
Pivot type:    [Zoom-in | Zoom-out | Customer segment | Value capture | Channel | Technology]

What stays (validated learnings):
  - [VA-{sol}-{n}: assumption text — validated with High confidence]

What changes:
  - [Description of what the pivot changes]

New assumptions to test:
  - [New assumption 1 — will become VA-{sol}-{n+1} in next cycle]
  - [New assumption 2]

Next validation cycle:
  [Create a new Validation Plan with the solution code, referencing this VD- record]
```

### If Kill

```
Key learnings:
  - [Learning 1 — what the evidence showed]
  - [Learning 2 — what was surprising]

What NOT to repeat:
  - [Dead end 1]
  - [Dead end 2]

Return to Discovery:
  [What the Discovery team should investigate next, informed by validation evidence]
```

## Rationale

[2-5 sentences explaining why this decision follows from the evidence. Reference specific experiment results and confidence levels. If the team disagrees with the evidence-based decision, document the disagreement and its resolution here.]

## Next actions

| Action | Owner | Deadline | Notes |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| [Specific action item] | [Person/team] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | [Context] |
| [Specific action item] | | | |

## Usage notes

- Create the Decision Record only when the [Evaluate](/docs/product-validation/phases/evaluate) phase confirms evidence sufficiency (all critical assumptions have ≥ Medium confidence).
- The Decision Record becomes the primary handoff artifact. For Persevere, it goes to engineering. For Pivot, it feeds the next validation cycle. For Kill, it goes to the learning archive.
- If the decision is Pivot, create a new Validation Plan for the next cycle. The new plan references this VD- record in its header.
- Multiple VD- records for the same solution code indicate iteration — each references the previous one, creating an audit trail of how the team arrived at the final decision.
