title: Experiment Card
description: Per-experiment template — method, success criteria, evidence log, and result
---

The Experiment Card documents a single experiment. One card per experiment, created during the [Design](/docs/product-validation/phases/design) phase and updated through [Execute](/docs/product-validation/phases/execute) and [Evaluate](/docs/product-validation/phases/evaluate).

## Experiment header

```
VE-ID:              [VE-{solution}-{n}]
Linked hypothesis:  [VH-{solution}-{n}]
Linked assumptions: [VA-{solution}-{n}, VA-{solution}-{m}]
Method:             [Technique name from the catalog]
Fidelity level:     [Level 1-5]
Date designed:      [YYYY-MM-DD]
Date started:       [YYYY-MM-DD]
Date completed:     [YYYY-MM-DD]
Status:             [Designed | Running | Evaluating | Complete]
```

## Success criteria

Define BEFORE execution. Do not modify after the experiment starts.

| Metric | Pass threshold | Fail threshold | Inconclusive range |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| [Primary metric, e.g., conversion rate] | [≥ X%] | [< Y%] | [Y% - X%] |
| [Secondary metric, if applicable] | [≥ X] | [< Y] | [Y - X] |

## Experiment parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Sample size (minimum) | [n participants/visitors/users] |
| Duration (maximum) | [n days/weeks] |
| Cost budget | [$n] |
| Target audience | [Segment description, recruitment channel] |
| Tools / platforms | [Analytics tool, survey tool, prototype tool, etc.] |

## Experiment description

[2-3 sentences describing what the experiment does, how users are recruited, and what they experience. This is the protocol that the Execute phase follows.]

## Evidence log

One row per observation. Populated during the [Execute](/docs/product-validation/phases/execute) phase.

| VV-ID | Date | Source | Type | Observation | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|------|------------|-------|
| `VV-{sol}-1` | YYYY-MM-DD | [Source] | Quant/Qual | [What was observed — fact, not interpretation] | [Anomalies, context] |
| `VV-{sol}-2` | | | | | |
| `VV-{sol}-3` | | | | | |

### Column definitions

- **VV-ID:** Unique evidence identifier. See [Conventions](/docs/product-validation/conventions).
- **Date:** When the observation was recorded.
- **Source:** Where the data came from (analytics platform, interview participant ID, survey response, etc.).
- **Type:** Quantitative (Quant) or Qualitative (Qual).
- **Observation:** What happened. Raw fact. No interpretation.
- **Notes:** Context, anomalies, or flags for the Evaluate phase.

## Result

Populated during the [Evaluate](/docs/product-validation/phases/evaluate) phase.

```
Primary metric result:    [Actual value]
Secondary metric result:  [Actual value, if applicable]
Outcome:                  [Pass | Fail | Inconclusive]
Confidence level:         [None | Low | Medium | High | Validated]
Confounding factors:      [None | List of factors]
Evaluator notes:          [Interpretation, synthesis, surprises]
```

## Usage notes

- Create one card per experiment during the Design phase. All fields above the evidence log must be complete before execution starts.
- The evidence log is populated during Execute. Add entries daily, not in bulk at the end.
- The result section is populated during Evaluate. Do not fill it in until the experiment is complete and evidence has been compiled.
- If the experiment result is Inconclusive, note whether a follow-up experiment is recommended and what would make it conclusive.
- Link the completed card back to the [Validation Plan](/docs/product-validation/templates/validation-plan) by updating the hypothesis register.
