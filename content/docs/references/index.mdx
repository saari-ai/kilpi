title: Informative References
description: How external standards map to NIST CSF subcategories
---

NIST CSF defines outcomes — what your security programme should achieve. It does not prescribe specific controls or technical configurations. That is where Informative References come in.

An Informative Reference is an external standard, guideline, or framework that maps to one or more CSF subcategories. It bridges the gap between "what outcome do we need?" (CSF) and "what specific controls does a given standard require?" (the reference).

## How we use them

Each subcategory in our CSF profile can be traced to one or more Informative References. These mappings answer the question: "If we satisfy this standard's requirements, which CSF outcomes are we covering?"

The references we use are:

- **[NIST CSF 2.0](./nist-csf)** — The raw subcategory definitions and implementation examples from the framework itself, organized by function. This is the source data that our methodology pages interpret and apply.
- **[ISO 27001](./iso-27001)** — Annex A controls mapped to CSF subcategories. The primary control catalogue for our ISMS.
- **[CIS Benchmarks](./cis-benchmarks)** — Concrete, testable configuration requirements mapped to CSF subcategories. Turns abstract controls into exact settings.
- **[SLSA](./slsa)** — Supply-chain Levels for Software Artefacts mapped to CSF subcategories. Addresses build integrity and provenance.

## How to read the mapping tables

Each reference page contains a mapping table with the following pattern:

1. **Left columns** identify the control or requirement in the external standard (e.g., an Annex A control number, a CIS benchmark category, or a SLSA level).
2. **Right column** lists the CSF subcategories that the control satisfies (e.g., <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>PR.PS-01</span>, <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>GV.SC-05</span>).
3. **Notes** provide context on how the mapping applies to our specific methodology.

A single external control can map to multiple subcategories, and a single subcategory can be covered by multiple external controls. The relationship is many-to-many.

## These are our mappings

NIST publishes its own Informative Reference catalogue, but the mappings on these pages are ours. They reflect the standards we have chosen to adopt and how we interpret their alignment with CSF subcategories for software product security. They are not official NIST mappings.
