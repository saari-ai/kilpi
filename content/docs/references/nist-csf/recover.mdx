## RC.RP: Incident Recovery Plan Execution

*Restoration activities are performed to ensure operational availability of systems and services affected by cybersecurity incidents*

### Subcategories

| ID | Outcome |
|----|---------|
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.RP-01</span> | The recovery portion of the incident response plan is executed once initiated from the incident response process |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.RP-02</span> | Recovery actions are selected, scoped, prioritized, and performed |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.RP-03</span> | The integrity of backups and other restoration assets is verified before using them for restoration |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.RP-04</span> | Critical mission functions and cybersecurity risk management are considered to establish post-incident operational norms |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.RP-05</span> | The integrity of restored assets is verified, systems and services are restored, and normal operating status is confirmed |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.RP-06</span> | The end of incident recovery is declared based on criteria, and incident-related documentation is completed |

### Implementation examples

| ID | Example |
|----|---------|
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.RP-01 Ex1</span> | Begin recovery procedures during or after incident response processes |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.RP-01 Ex2</span> | Make all individuals with recovery responsibilities aware of the plans for recovery and the authorizations required to implement each aspect of the plans |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.RP-02 Ex1</span> | Select recovery actions based on the criteria defined in the incident response plan and available resources |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.RP-02 Ex2</span> | Change planned recovery actions based on a reassessment of organizational needs and resources |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.RP-03 Ex1</span> | Check restoration assets for indicators of compromise, file corruption, and other integrity issues before use |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.RP-04 Ex1</span> | Use business impact and system categorization records (including service delivery objectives) to validate that essential services are restored in the appropriate order |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.RP-04 Ex2</span> | Work with system owners to confirm the successful restoration of systems and the return to normal operations |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.RP-04 Ex3</span> | Monitor the performance of restored systems to verify the adequacy of the restoration |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.RP-05 Ex1</span> | Check restored assets for indicators of compromise and remediation of root causes of the incident before production use |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.RP-05 Ex2</span> | Verify the correctness and adequacy of the restoration actions taken before putting a restored system online |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.RP-06 Ex1</span> | Prepare an after-action report that documents the incident itself, the response and recovery actions taken, and lessons learned |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.RP-06 Ex2</span> | Declare the end of incident recovery once the criteria are met |

## RC.CO: Incident Recovery Communication

*Restoration activities are coordinated with internal and external parties*

### Subcategories

| ID | Outcome |
|----|---------|
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.CO-03</span> | Recovery activities and progress in restoring operational capabilities are communicated to designated internal and external stakeholders |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.CO-04</span> | Public updates on incident recovery are shared using approved methods and messaging |

{/* Note: RC.CO numbering starts at 03 in CSF 2.0. */}

### Implementation examples

| ID | Example |
|----|---------|
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.CO-03 Ex1</span> | Securely share recovery information, including restoration progress, consistent with response plans and information sharing agreements |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.CO-03 Ex2</span> | Regularly update senior leadership on recovery status and restoration progress for major incidents |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.CO-03 Ex3</span> | Follow the rules and protocols defined in contracts for incident information sharing between the organization and its suppliers |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.CO-03 Ex4</span> | Coordinate crisis communication between the organization and its critical suppliers |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.CO-04 Ex1</span> | Follow the organization's breach notification procedures for recovering from a data breach incident |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RC.CO-04 Ex2</span> | Explain the steps being taken to recover from the incident and to prevent a recurrence |
