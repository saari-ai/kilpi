| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RS.MA-04 Ex2</span> | Coordinate incident escalation or elevation with designated internal and external stakeholders |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RS.MA-05 Ex1</span> | Apply incident recovery criteria to known and assumed characteristics of the incident to determine whether incident recovery processes should be initiated |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RS.MA-05 Ex2</span> | Take the possible operational disruption of incident recovery activities into account |

## RS.AN: Incident Analysis

*Investigations are conducted to ensure effective response and support forensics and recovery activities*

### Subcategories

| ID | Outcome |
|----|---------|
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RS.AN-03</span> | Analysis is performed to establish what has taken place during an incident and the root cause of the incident |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RS.AN-06</span> | Actions performed during an investigation are recorded, and the records' integrity and provenance are preserved |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RS.AN-07</span> | Incident data and metadata are collected, and their integrity and provenance are preserved |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RS.AN-08</span> | An incident's magnitude is estimated and validated |

{/* Note: RS.AN numbering has gaps (01-02, 04-05) in CSF 2.0. */}

### Implementation examples

| ID | Example |
|----|---------|
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RS.AN-03 Ex1</span> | Determine the sequence of events that occurred during the incident and which assets and resources were involved in each event |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RS.AN-03 Ex2</span> | Attempt to determine what vulnerabilities, threats, and threat actors were directly or indirectly involved in the incident |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RS.AN-03 Ex3</span> | Analyze the incident to find the underlying, systemic root causes |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RS.AN-03 Ex4</span> | Check any cyber deception technology for additional information on attacker behavior |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RS.AN-06 Ex1</span> | Require each incident responder and others (e.g., system administrators, cybersecurity engineers) who perform incident response tasks to record their actions and make the record immutable |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RS.AN-06 Ex2</span> | Require the incident lead to document the incident in detail and be responsible for preserving the integrity of the documentation and the sources of all information being reported |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RS.AN-07 Ex1</span> | Collect, preserve, and safeguard the integrity of all pertinent incident data and metadata (e.g., data source, date/time of collection) based on evidence preservation and chain-of-custody procedures |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RS.AN-08 Ex1</span> | Review other potential targets of the incident to search for indicators of compromise and evidence of persistence |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>RS.AN-08 Ex2</span> | Automatically run tools on targets to look for indicators of compromise and evidence of persistence |
