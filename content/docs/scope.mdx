title: Scope
description: How Kilpi applies at the organisational and product levels
---

Kilpi operates at two levels: **organisational** and **product**. Not every NIST function applies at both levels. This page explains which functions belong where and why.

## Organisational scope

The organisational scope covers the business as a whole. It establishes the security foundations that all products inherit. Use the [Template (Org)](/docs/templates/complete) to apply this scope.

| Function | What the org owns | Categories |
|----------|-------------------|------------|
| Govern | Risk strategy, roles, policy, oversight, supply chain | GV.OC, GV.RM, GV.RR, GV.PO, GV.OV, GV.SC |
| Identify | Org-wide asset landscape, risk appetite | ID.AM, ID.RA, ID.IM |
| Protect | Platform-level TLS, shared auth infrastructure, baseline hardening | PR.AA, PR.DS, PR.PS, PR.IR |
| Detect | Platform-wide monitoring and alerting infrastructure | DE.CM, DE.AE |
| Respond | Incident response process, playbooks, escalation matrix | RS.MA, RS.AN, RS.CO, RS.MI |
| Recover | Recovery framework, communication plan | RC.RP, RC.CO |

Products do not redo Govern, Respond, or Recover. Those are organisational concerns.

## Product scope

The product scope applies to an individual product or system component. It covers a subset of functions where the specifics vary per component. Use the [Template (Component)](/docs/templates/component) to apply this scope.

| Function | What the product owns | Inherits from org | Template |
|----------|-----------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Identify | Asset register, threat model (STRIDE), risk assessment | Org-wide risk appetite, severity thresholds | [Template (Component)](/docs/templates/component) |
| Protect | Auth model, encryption choices, input validation, product-specific controls | Platform baselines (TLS, shared auth, hardening) | [Template (Component)](/docs/templates/component) |
| Detect | Monitoring rules, alert thresholds specific to the product | Platform-wide monitoring infrastructure | [Template (Component)](/docs/templates/component) |
