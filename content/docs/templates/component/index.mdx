description: Template for products and system components that inherit organisational-level governance
---

This template covers the subset of NIST CSF 2.0 functions that apply at the component level — individual products, services, and system components. Components inherit Govern, Respond, and Recover from the organisation. They own their own Identify, Protect, and (partially) Detect.

Each component boundary is responsible for completing this template and submitting the completed version to your organisation's security compliance records. See [Scope](/docs/scope) for detail on what the organisation owns vs what components own.

| Function | Categories |
|----------|------------|

| [Protect](/docs/templates/component/protect) | Controls specific to this component |
| [Detect](/docs/templates/component/detect) | Monitoring rules and alert thresholds for this component |
