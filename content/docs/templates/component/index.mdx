description: Template for products and system components that inherit organisational-level governance
---

This template covers the NIST CSF 2.0 functions that apply at the component level — individual products, services, and system components. Components inherit governance (GV), response processes (RS), and recovery plans (RC) from the organisation. They own Identify, Protect, and Detect.

Each component boundary is responsible for completing this template and submitting the completed version to your organisation's security compliance records. See [Scope](/docs/scope) for detail on how functions are divided between org and component levels.
