description: Fill-in templates for applying the Kilpi methodology
---

Two templates are provided, depending on the scope of what you're securing.

| Template | Scope | Functions covered |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| [Org](/docs/templates/complete) | Organisation-wide | GV, RS, RC |
| [Component](/docs/templates/component) | Product or system component | ID, PR, DE only (inherits GV, RS, RC from org) |

These are master templates. Clone the relevant template before filling in — do not edit the templates directly.

Start with [Scope](/docs/scope) to understand which template applies.
